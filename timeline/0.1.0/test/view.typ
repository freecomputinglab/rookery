// The RENDERED half of the fixture, and the only file here that produces output.
//
// `units.typ` asserts values; `#timeline-view` returns content and branches on
// `target()`, so nothing about its markup can be asserted there. This compiles to
// HTML and `check.sh` greps what came out — the same division `@rookery/core`'s
// demo/pure and demo/rheo make between compiling and inspecting.
//
// Four cases, each the one the design turns on:
//   1. a log straddling `today` — the divider belongs, both sides exist
//   2. every event past — NO divider, because it would mark nothing
//   3. two events on ONE DAY — times shown rather than a date twice
//   4. the same log with and without `ladder:` — record vs progress

= 4. The same log, with a ladder

#timeline-view((created: d(2026, 10, 1)), straddling, today: NOW, ladder: JOURNAL)

= 5. Timed events on the reference date itself

// The case that caught the bug: a date-only `today:` — which is what a site
// passes — against events carrying times on that very day. Both have HAPPENED, and
// a rail that called them booked would be wrong about the commonest call there is.

// The prose that is ABOUT one event, which used to end up on the note's body and
// read as a claim about the whole thing. One event has a note, one does not — a

// Two reviews, written numbered because a dict cannot carry `review` twice, and a
// ladder that says "any review". The expected rungs ahead must render as `accepted`
// and `revision` — never as `revision-*` — and `review` must NOT be listed as still
// to come, since one has already happened.

= 8. A note spanning two paragraphs

// It rendered EMPTY inside a `<p>`: Typst paragraphs are block content and a `<p>`
// cannot contain them, so the element collapsed and took the prose with it.
#timeline-view((:), entries(timeline: (
  submitted: (
    timestamp: d(2026, 5, 1),
    note: [
      First paragraph of the note.

      Second paragraph, which is what broke it.
