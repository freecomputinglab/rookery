# @rookery/timeline

A dated lifecycle log for [`@rookery/core`](../../core/0.1.0) notes, contributed as
tag metadata — the events, the ladders that order them, and the rail that draws
them.

```typst
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": idea
#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": dates

#idea("ship", tags: entries(deadline: datetime(year: 2026, month: 9, day: 1)))[
  Cut the release.
]
```

## 0.1.0 — renamed from `@rookery/core-dates`

This package was `@rookery/core-dates` up to 0.5.0 (released) and 0.6.0
(unreleased). The rename is not cosmetic: `dates` named one field of what it now
owns, which is a note's **lifecycle** — an ordered sequence of dated entries, the
derivations over them (`stage-of`, `is-settled`, `rung`, `next-stage`), and
`#timeline-view`, the rail that draws them.

`rookery-states` was considered and declined. `deadline`, `scheduled` and `created`
are not states: a deadline is a date *attached to* a note, where `closed` is a state
the note is *in*. Those are the store's most-used reserved names, so `states` would
be misnamed for exactly them — and following that name honestly argues for moving
plans back out into their own keys, which is org-mode's split and this package's own
original design, undoing the unification 0.6.0 made deliberately. `timeline` covers
plans and events alike without claiming either is a state, and it is the word the
code had already reached for: `timeline(entry, tags)` is the reader that merges
rookery's `created` with the log.

### What moved, if you are coming from `rookery-dates`

The old package's name is written WITHOUT a colon before its version below, and
that is deliberate rather than sloppy: `just check-versions` greps for the
`@rheo/<pkg>:<x.y.z>` spec form and fails on one naming a version that is not in
this repo. `rookery-dates/` has been removed, so the spec form here — in prose
about what the package used to be called — would fail the lint. MEASURED: it did,
on this exact line.

| was | is |
| --- | --- |
| `@rookery/core-dates` 0.5.0 and 0.6.0 | `@rookery/timeline:0.1.0` |
| the `date-log` tag key | `timeline-log` |
| `dates(scheduled:, deadline:, timeline:)` | `entries(scheduled:, deadline:, timeline:)` |
| `log-view(..)` | `timeline-view(..)` |
| `src/rookery-dates.css`, `@layer rookery-dates` | `src/timeline.css`, `@layer timeline` |
| `.date-log`, `.date-log-event`, `--date-log-*` | `.timeline`, `.timeline-event`, `--timeline-*` |
| an entry's `on` field | `timestamp`, matching the write key |

Everything else keeps its name: `dated`, `dated-idea`, `timeline-of`, `stage-date`,
`has-stage`, `entered-of`, `deadline-of`, `scheduled-of`, `created-of`,
`updated-of`, `timeline`, `stage-of`, `stage-on`, `next-of`, `days-at-stage`,
`days-in-flight`, `is-settled`, `rung`, `next-stage`, the `as-*` extractors and the
three reserved stage constants. None of those was ever named after "dates".

### What the log is, and why there is one

`scheduled` and `deadline` used to be two independent tag keys and both were PLANS
— the org-mode pair. A log is the third thing: what happened, and when. Org-mode's
`LOGBOOK` to those two. One mechanism then carries arbitrarily complex lifecycles —
a todo's scheduled/activated/closed, a submission's
deadline/submitted/review/accepted — without this package naming any of those
states itself.

**Nothing you call has a changed signature.** `entries(deadline: d)` writes a
`deadline` entry; `deadline-of(t)` reads it back. That was the point of doing it
this way: `is-overdue`, `is-upcoming`, `@rookery/todos`' readiness check and
every existing call site kept working. What you gain is everything below.

## A skin over rookery

If you use plain rookery you import `idea`, `window` and the rest from rookery. If
you use this package you import those **same names from here** instead, and get
versions that take its date arguments:

```typst
#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": idea, rookery, window
#show: rookery

#idea("ship", deadline: d, timeline: (submitted: d2))[Cut the release.]
#window("ship")   // rookery's own, unchanged
```

**Two names are overridden and everything else passes through.** `idea` is
`dated(rookery.idea)`; `tagged-idea` is the same decoration applied to the factory,
so a family you build over this skin — a `#submission`, a `#todo` — takes the date
arguments without wrapping anything itself. `window`, `ideas`, `tag-data`,
`note-href`, `rookery` and the rest are rookery's, untouched.

`dated-idea` is kept as an alias of `idea`, so call sites written before the skin
keep working.

**You can still import from rookery directly**, and nothing changes if you do. The
skin is opt-in: it is where a name comes FROM, not which package provides it.

## How it composes

`entries(..)` returns a TAG FRAGMENT — a plain dictionary you merge into a
rookery `tags:` argument. That is the entire write surface.

The CORE of this package does not import `@rookery/core`, and `@rookery/core`
knows nothing about this package. A tag fragment is just a dictionary, so
composition needs no import relationship in either direction: any package, and any
hand-written `#idea`, can use it. `dated(mint)` keeps that true for the decorator
too, by taking the minting function as an argument. Two things here do import
rookery: the one-line `dated-idea` binding, and `#upcoming`, which reads the note
REGISTRY through `ideas()` because it draws one row per note across a corpus and no
argument could hand it that corpus. Rookery accepts a dictionary
for `tags:` directly, so composing with ordinary tags is dictionary merge:

```typst
#idea("ship", tags: (phd: none, urgent: none) + entries(deadline: d))[...]
```

An omitted date emits **no key at all**, not a key valued `none`. A `none`-valued
key is a *flat* tag — it renders as a pill and reads as a
plain label — so `entries()` with nothing to say stays silent. `entries()` with no
arguments is `(:)`, which merges into anything and changes nothing.

## The key, and the log inside it

One key: `timeline-log`, holding an array of `(stage: <str>, timestamp: <datetime>, ..)`,
**sorted by date**.

It is namespaced with a `date-` prefix per rookery's key convention: a tag key
becomes a CSS class fragment (`.idea-tag-timeline-log`, which you can style or theme
like any other tag), and a bare `log` is a generic name two packages could both
reach for and silently collide over. Because it is a *valued* tag it renders no
pill, but it is still presence-filterable by key — `#window(tags: "timeline-log")`
finds every note carrying any dates at all.

```typst
#idea("wolf", tags: entries(
  deadline: datetime(year: 2026, month: 11, day: 1),
  timeline: (
    submitted:         datetime(year: 2026, month: 10, day: 28),
    longlisted:        datetime(year: 2026, month: 12, day: 15),
    "first-interview": datetime(year: 2027, month: 1, day: 20),
  ),
))[...]
```

**Sorted at write time**, once, rather than in every reader. Two consequences,
both wanted: the stored value is unambiguous, and the order you WROTE the entries
in cannot lie about the timeline. Ties keep the written order — MEASURED on typst
0.15.x, a dictionary preserves insertion order, so that is sound; and because
`array.sorted` is not documented as stable, the tie is held by decorating each
entry with its written index rather than by trusting the sort.

**Entries may be FUTURE-DATED, and that is the ordinary shape of a plan** rather
than an edge case. A deadline is by definition a date that has not arrived; an
interview is booked before it is held; a decision is promised before it comes. So
the log doubles as a calendar, and "what stage is this at" means "the last thing
that has actually happened" — which is why `stage-of` takes a `today:` and
`deadline-of` does not.

### An entry may carry its own content

Two write forms, and the shorthand is the common one:

```typst
timeline: (
  activated: datetime(..),                  // a bare date
  closed: (
    timestamp: datetime(..),                // reserved, required
    note: [Landed as rookery's derived `label`.],  // reserved, rendered by the rail
    estimated: true,                        // FREE — yours, stored and ignored here
  ),
)
```

**Why an entry needs content of its own.** Prose about an event kept ending up on
the note, where it reads as a claim about the whole thing. In the project this was
built for, seven submission bodies carried a sentence that belonged to one event —
*"Offered and accepted, for autumn 2026"*, *"Dropped — not a good fit"*, *"Read and
let go"* — and one file opened with a **fourteen-line comment** explaining
per-entry date provenance at file level, invisible on the built site, because no
entry could carry it.

`timestamp` and `note` are reserved. **Every other key is yours**, stored verbatim
and ignored by everything here — which is what lets per-entry provenance
(`estimated: true`, a reference number, whatever) exist without this package
needing to know what it means.

Read back, an entry is `(stage:, timestamp:, ..your keys)`:

```typst
#let e = timeline-of(tags).first()
e.stage      // "closed"
e.timestamp  // datetime
e.note       // content, if it has one
```

**A `note` can never be projected.** rookery's `tag-index` asserts scalars, because
`json.encode` of content silently emits a structural blob — so a note is
Typst-side rendering only. The log already could not ride on an `#ideas()` row, so
this costs nothing new, but it is worth knowing rather than discovering.

Each refusal names the stage: a dictionary with no `timestamp`, a `timestamp` that
is not a datetime, a `note` that is neither content nor a string, and an entry that
is neither a datetime nor a dictionary.

### Three reserved stages, and no more

| stage | from | exported as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scheduled` | `entries(scheduled: ..)` | `SCHEDULED-STAGE` |
| `deadline` | `entries(deadline: ..)` | `DEADLINE-STAGE` |
| `closed` | your own `timeline:` | `CLOSED-STAGE` |

Everything else in a log is the CONSUMER's vocabulary. `@rookery/todos` owns
`activated`; a submission tracker owns `submitted`/`review`/`accepted`. The three
above are exported so a consumer names them without hardcoding a string — the
same reason the old key constants were.

A stage name must be alphanumerics and interior hyphens only, because it has to
survive being a CSS class fragment and an HTML attribute value, which is where a
consumer's view will put it.

### `dated(mint)` — dates as named arguments

```typst
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": idea, tagged-idea
#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": dated, dated-idea

#dated-idea("ship", deadline: d)[Cut the release.]

// or put your own tag family on top:
#let submission = dated(tagged-idea("submission"))
#submission("wolf", deadline: d, timeline: (submitted: d2))[...]
```

A DECORATOR rather than a finished constructor, and that is what makes the
layering work: a constructor has no seam for a consumer to add its own tag family,
and both `@rookery/todos`' `#todo` and a project's own `#submission` need
one. It also keeps this package's core import-free — the decorator receives its
constructor as an ARGUMENT, so there is nothing to import. `dated-idea` is the one
line here that imports rookery, and it exists only so the common case reads as one
name rather than two.

Your own `tags:` is kept whole and the date fragment folded in on top. All four
shapes rookery accepts for `tags:` are normalized, so `tags: "phd"` works
alongside `deadline:`.

## Reading dates back

```typst
#context {
  let t = tag-data().at("idea:ship")
  deadline-of(t)    // -> datetime or none
  scheduled-of(t)   // -> datetime or none
}
```

Both take the tag DICTIONARY rather than a note name, so they stay pure
functions and need no registry read of their own. Walking the corpus is one
`#tag-data()` and these per row.

### The log's own readers

```typst
timeline-of(t)                  // -> ((stage: "submitted", on: ..), ..) or ()
stage-date(t, "longlisted")// -> that entry's date; the LATEST where it repeats
has-stage(t, "offered")    // -> bool
entered-of(t)              // -> the FIRST entry's date — "in flight since"
```

`timeline-of` returns `()` rather than `none` when absent, so you can map over it
without a guard: an empty log and no log are the same question.

`stage-date` returns the LATEST where a stage appears more than once. A todo
deferred and then re-deferred has two `scheduled` entries, and "deferred until"
means the current deferral rather than the first one ever set.

These need no reference date. The ones that do are under "Derived predicates".

### created and updated

`created-of(entry)` takes an `#ideas()` ROW and reads rookery core's own
`created` field.

**`created` is deliberately NOT in the log.** Rookery already resolves it from
`#idea(created:)`, then the document's `#set document(date:)`, then nothing, and
publishes it on every `#ideas()` row — a second copy here could only drift from
the first. It also stays a ROW field rather than a tag value for a load-bearing
reason: rookery keeps tag values off rows, so anything in the tag dictionary — the
log included — costs a `#tag-data()` walk to reach, and a date every consumer
filters and sorts by should be free.

`updated-of(entry, tags)` is DERIVED: the log's last entry where there is one,
else `created`. Note the extra parameter — the answer now comes from two sources.
Rookery 0.6.0 removed its own `updated` field, on the grounds that a
hand-maintained "last touched" is a second date the author has to remember and one
that can contradict what actually happened to the note. For the first time this
function means something the note itself knows.

`timeline(entry, tags)` puts the two together for display:

```typst
timeline(row, t)
// -> ((stage: "created", on: ..), (stage: "deadline", on: ..), ..)
```

`created` LEADS and is not written into the log — one store per fact, one view
over both. Writing it in would give the note two copies of its creation date that
could drift apart.

## Derived predicates

```typst
#let NOW = datetime(year: 2026, month: 8, day: 25)

is-overdue(t, today: NOW)                    // deadline strictly before NOW
is-upcoming(t, today: NOW, within: 7)        // deadline in [NOW, NOW+7]
is-scheduled-now(t, today: NOW)              // scheduled on or before NOW
```

`is-overdue` is *strictly* before, so a deadline falling on the reference date
is due rather than overdue — the day is not over. `is-upcoming` is inclusive at
both ends and excludes anything already overdue, so a row belongs to exactly one
of the two.

`is-scheduled-now` is `false` for a note with no `scheduled` entry, which reads
as "not scheduled" rather than "scheduled for now". A consumer wanting "nothing
is deferring this" asks `scheduled-of(t) == none or is-scheduled-now(t)`.

### The log's predicates

```typst
stage-of(t, today: NOW)          // last entry ON OR BEFORE NOW — what has happened
stage-on(t, today: NOW)          // that entry's date
next-of(t, today: NOW)           // first entry AFTER NOW — the next appointment
days-at-stage(t, today: NOW)     // whole days at the current stage
days-in-flight(t, today: NOW)    // whole days since the first entry
```

Each takes a `today:` because entries may be future-dated. `stage-of` is `none`
for an empty log AND for a log whose every entry is still to come — an open call
nothing has been sent to — and deliberately does not distinguish them; ask
`timeline-of(t).len()` if you need to.

`next-of` is what gives a view a real "next appointment" column: a booked
interview or a promised decision is an ordinary entry, and this finds it.

`days-in-flight` measures from `entered-of` rather than from the first PAST entry,
so a note whose log opens with a future deadline reports a NEGATIVE number rather
than none. That reads correctly: it is not in flight yet, and by how much.

### Ladders: `is-settled`, `rung`, `next-stage`

`accepted` ENDS a conference submission and is the MIDDLE of a journal's ladder.
`offered` ends a job application. No package can know that, so the vocabulary is
a PARAMETER and only the reasoning lives here — the same split this package
already makes for `today:`.

```typst
#let JOB = (
  transit:  ("submitted", "longlisted", "first-interview", "finalist"),
  terminal: ("offered", "rejected", "declined", "dropped", "missed"),
)

is-settled(t, ladder: JOB, today: NOW)   // current stage is terminal
rung(t, ladder: JOB, today: NOW)         // 0-based index in `transit`
next-stage(t, ladder: JOB, today: NOW)   // the next transit rung, or none
```

`transit` is ordered by progress; `terminal` is unordered and its MEMBERSHIP is
what settles a note.

### A rung may name a FAMILY, so a stage can repeat

A rung ending in `-*` matches any stage sharing that prefix:

```typst
#let JOURNAL = (
  transit: ("submitted", "review-*", "accepted", "revision-*"),
  terminal: ("published", "rejected", "withdrawn"),
)
```

```typst
timeline: (
  submitted:   d1,
  "review-1":  d2,
  "review-2":  d3,   // as many as it takes
  accepted:    d4,
  "revision-1": d5,
  published:   d6,
)
```

**Why numbered names rather than a repeated key.** A Typst dict rejects a repeated
key outright — MEASURED, `(review: 1, review: 2)` fails to parse with *"duplicate
key: review"* — so a stage that can happen more than once has to be written with
distinct names, and the ladder has to be able to say "any review".

`review-*` matches `review-1` and `review-12`. It does **not** match `reviewer` —
the hyphen is part of the prefix — and does not match a bare `review` either, since
that names no occurrence and a lifecycle using the family form should say which one.

**One form, at one position.** A pattern is a prefix: no `*` in the middle, no bare
`*`, no character classes. Each addition would be another way for two rungs to
overlap, and a ladder whose rungs overlap is refused — including the non-obvious
case where a family in one array matches a name in the other.

`rung-name(pattern)` strips the `-*`, and everything that renders a rung goes
through it, so `#timeline-view` draws `review` and never `review *`. A family rung
also drops out of what is drawn as still-ahead once **any** of its occurrences has
happened: after two reviews, more are possible but no longer expected.

**No branching machinery is needed** for a lifecycle that forks. `submitted` → any
number of reviews → either `rejected`, or `accepted` → any number of revisions →
`published` is a linear ladder plus terminal membership, because a terminal stage
settles a note from any rung. The only cost is that `next-stage` after a review says
`accepted` when `rejected` is equally possible — and that reader is documented as an
expectation rather than a promise. `rung` returns `transit.len()` for anything terminal, so
finished work sorts past everything still moving, and it is an INTEGER so it drops
straight into a sort key or a projection.

`next-stage` is an EXPECTATION, not a promise — nothing here knows a process will
advance, only what the ladder says would come next if it did. Render it as such.

An UNKNOWN stage is not an error: `rung` is `none` and `is-settled` is `false`. A
vocabulary grows, and a note written against tomorrow's ladder must degrade rather
than fail the build of an unrelated page. A name appearing in BOTH arrays IS
refused, by name, because that is the one mistake that would make `is-settled` and
`rung` disagree about the same note silently.

`ladder:` has no default. A default ladder would be a vocabulary, which is the one
thing this package must not own.

### Projecting the log onto a row: the `as-*` extractors

Rookery keeps tag values off `#ideas()` rows, so a log is reachable only through
`#tag-data()` — and `tag-index`'s `(from: ..)` form is the way back on. These are
the functions to hand it:

```typst
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": tag-index
#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": (
  DEADLINE-STAGE, as-date, as-days-in-flight, as-rung, as-settled, as-stage,
)

#let INDEX = tag-index((
  stage:    (from: as-stage(today: NOW)),
  deadline: (from: as-date(DEADLINE-STAGE)),
  rung:     (from: as-rung(ladder: JOB, today: NOW)),
  settled:  (from: as-settled(ladder: JOB, today: NOW)),
  waiting:  (from: as-days-in-flight(today: NOW)),
))
```

Each is a partially-applied factory rather than a function called with the tag
dictionary, which is what lets a spec read as data. A date comes back as a
zero-padded `[year][month][day]` STRING, never a `datetime`: rookery's scalar
assert would refuse the datetime, and the string sorts lexically in date order — so
a projected date is a free sort key.

Dates are compared as zero-padded `[year][month][day]` strings, which sidesteps
the question of how `datetime` orders as a sort key — the same technique rookery
uses in its own id sorting.

## `#timeline-view` — the log as a vertical rail

One of the two functions here that draw something (`#upcoming` below is the other),
and the reason this package ships a stylesheet at all.

```typst
#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": timeline-view

#context timeline-view(row, tag-data().at(row.id), today: NOW)
```

```
28.10.26  ●  submitted
          │  Sent the 500-word abstract, not the full paper.
15.11.26  ●  under-review
20.1.27   ●  revise-resubmit          <- current: bold
──────────┼──────────────────  today
 3.3.27   ○  resubmitted
```

**The line ends at the last filled dot.** A track running on past the last thing
that happened implies a record that continues where it stops. It is drawn as a
segment per past row, abutting to form one rule, with the last one cut short at its
own dot — CSS cannot ask a single element where the last past row is.

**The current stage is bold and every other is greyed.** Which matters most on a
laddered rail: with six reached rungs drawn, nothing otherwise says which one the
note is at.

The dates are a COLUMN in a left gutter, the line runs between the columns, and the
dots sit on it. Short form (`27.8.26`, with `HH:MM` appended where an entry carries
a time) because a run of them is meant to be scanned down — "27 Aug 2026" is three
words per row and reads as prose, not as a column.

**A dot per event, FILLED for what has happened and HOLLOW for what is booked**,
with a `today` divider between them. That split is the main thing a log knows and
the reason the view exists: entries may be future-dated by design — a deadline has
not arrived, an interview is booked before it is held — so a view that treats
every entry alike throws the distinction away.

The divider is emitted **only where there is something on both sides of it**. A
rail whose every event is past does not need a line saying where now is.

`created` leads the rail, from rookery's own field via `timeline` — so the record
starts when the note was written and the log is what happened to it since.

### An event's own prose

Where an entry carries a `note`, the rail renders it under that event's stage and
date — inside the same list item, so the dot stays aligned to the prose it belongs
to. That is the whole reason an entry can carry content: a sentence about one event
on the note's body reads as a claim about the whole thing.

A note may span more than one paragraph. Its container is a `<div>` and not a `<p>`
for exactly that reason — MEASURED, a two-paragraph note inside a `<p>` renders
EMPTY, because Typst's paragraphs are block content a `<p>` cannot legally contain
and the whole element collapses.

An event without a note gets no element at all rather than an empty one, and an
**expected rung never gets one** — a rung that has not happened cannot have prose
about it, and the ladder supplies names only.

### With a ladder it becomes a progress indicator

`ladder:` defaults to `none` and the two registers are visibly different:

| call | what you get |
| --- | --- |
| `timeline-view(row, tags, today: NOW)` | a RECORD — the log's own events, nothing more |
| `timeline-view(row, tags, today: NOW, ladder: JOURNAL)` | a PROGRESS indicator — the events, then the unreached rungs, undated and greyed |

An unreached rung is an **expectation, never a promise**: nothing here knows a
process will advance, only what the ladder says would come next if it did. The
class is `timeline-expected` and the stylesheet dots its outline for that reason.

### Same-day events show their times

Two events on one day would otherwise render the same date twice with a rule
between them, saying nothing. Where an event shares its date with another, both
show `HH:MM` beside it:

```
●  27 Aug 2026 15:00   activated
●  27 Aug 2026 16:00   closed
```

Guarded on `.hour() != none`, because a date-only entry cannot be asked for its
time — MEASURED, `.display("[hour]")` on one panics with *"failed to format
datetime (insufficient information)"*.

**Has-it-happened is compared at the coarser of the two precisions.** A bare
`today:` — which is what a site passes, since a reference date is a date — means
the whole DAY, so an event timed 16:00 on that date has happened. Only when both
the event and the reference carry a time does the clock decide. Ordering is
different and uses full precision, so a date-only `deadline` still precedes a
timed event during that day.

### Styling it

Every class is a published contract: `.timeline` on the list, `.timeline-event`
per row plus exactly one of `.timeline-past` / `.timeline-future` /
`.timeline-expected`, `.timeline-stage`, `.timeline-when` and `.timeline-note` inside, `.timeline-current`
alongside `.timeline-past` on the one row that is the current stage, and
`.timeline-today` on the divider. Six custom properties theme it without
overriding a rule — `--timeline-line`, `--timeline-fg`, `--timeline-muted`,
`--timeline-dot`, `--timeline-gap`, `--timeline-note`, `--timeline-gutter` (the
width of the date column, and what the line's position is measured from).

### What it deliberately is not

A horizontal track (crowds past four events, and gives a long stage name nowhere
to go), a definition list (says nothing about order, or about whether an event has
happened), an inline sparkline (a different component, for a table of many notes — which
`#upcoming` below now is),
and **no durations of any kind** — no "126 days in flight", no per-event gaps. The
reader can subtract, and a computed interval resting on a stand-in date looks more
precise than it is.

On a paged or EPUB target there is no rail to draw, so the same events render as
an ordinary list.

## `#upcoming` — the log as a dated list across many notes

The rail's sibling: `#timeline-view` draws ONE note's log down a line, this draws
ONE ROW PER NOTE across a whole corpus, ordered by what is coming next.

```typst
#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": upcoming, DEADLINE-STAGE, SCHEDULED-STAGE

#upcoming(
  tags: "submission",
  stage: (DEADLINE-STAGE, SCHEDULED-STAGE),
  today: NOW,
  from: datetime(year: 2026, month: 1, day: 1),
)

Three columns: when, the note's name, and the stage it is CURRENTLY at. Every row
links to the note.

**`today:` is required here**, and this is the one place in the package where it is.
The predicates in `when.typ` fall back to the document's own `#set document(date:)`
before they panic; these two views do not, and assert on the argument instead. A
predicate answers a question you asked, but a queue asserts an ordering, a window and
a set of stage badges — all of which read as facts about the reader's today. A
document date set once and then forgotten makes every one of them quietly wrong
rather than visibly absent, and Typst has no wall clock to check them against (see
[Every date is author-supplied](#every-date-is-author-supplied-and-here-is-why)).

### The arguments

| | |
|---|---|
| `tags:` / `match:` | rookery's own selection vocabulary, passed straight to `ideas()` |
| `filter:` | a predicate over the note's tag dictionary, ANDed with the above |
| `stage:` | which log entry dates the row — see below |
| `name-from:` | a tag key naming the note whose name and link the row takes — see below |
| `today:` | the reference date — **required here**, see below |
| `from:` | a `datetime`; drops a row dated before it |
| `within:` | days; drops a row dated later than `today + within` |
| `limit:` | truncate after sorting |
| `countdown:` | draw how long you have, as a chip on the right — see below |
| `title:` | optional label above the list |
| `empty:` | what to show when nothing survives |

### `stage:` — which entry dates the row

**The log is a dictionary of named dates, and only the caller knows which name it is
waiting on.** A job application is queued by its `deadline`; a call whose dates are
not published yet is queued by the `scheduled` date it is expected to post on; a
conference is queued by whichever of the two it has. So `stage:` takes one name, or
an array of names in **priority order**:

```typst
#upcoming(today: NOW, stage: (DEADLINE-STAGE, SCHEDULED-STAGE))  // deadline, else the watch date
#upcoming(today: NOW, stage: "campus-visit")                     // queued by one booked event
```

The date resolves in three steps:

1. the first of `stage:` the log carries — that date, rendered firm;
2. otherwise the next entry dated **after** `today:` (`next-of`) — that date,
   rendered **soft**;
3. otherwise nothing: the row renders `—` and sorts after every dated row.

Step 2 is the row with no deadline that nonetheless has something booked, and it
belongs in the queue — an interview next month is exactly what is imminent about it.
The soft styling says only that the date came from a different entry than the one you
asked to be queued by; it is not a claim about the date's reliability.

Rows sort **ascending, oldest first**, which puts a date already behind you at the
TOP. An overdue row is the most urgent thing on the list, not the stalest.

### `countdown:` — how long you have, on the right of the row

Off by default. With it on, a row whose date falls within a fortnight gains a chip at
the right-hand end reading `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, `in 5 days` or
`9 days ago`:

```typst
#upcoming(tags: "submission", today: NOW, within: 90, countdown: true)
```

```
20.8.26   Media Theory Conference 2027       UNDER REVIEW   7 DAYS AGO
27.8.26   Cornell Society for the Humanities                TODAY
 2.9.26   Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence               IN 6 DAYS

```

Three bands, and the cutoffs are fixed:

| | |
|---|---|
| **urgent** | today, tomorrow, and anything overdue |
| **soon** | two to seven days |
| **later** | eight to fourteen days |
| *(nothing)* | further off than a fortnight, or no date at all |

Three rather than two because the colours are a **ramp** — red, orange, yellow — and
it is the same ramp `@rookery/todos` colours a todo's priority with. The bands
themselves are `#countdown(days)`, exported from this package: a pure function of one
integer, so another package drawing the same chip derives nothing of its own.

**Overdue counts as urgent, and has no floor.** Rows sort ascending, so a date already
behind you sits at the TOP of the list; a row that fell out of the band after a
fortnight would go quiet exactly as it got worse. `100 days ago` is a countdown too.

**The edges are words.** Nobody writes `in 1 days`, and the three dates a reader acts
on today are the three worth naming.

The chip is an ordinary `.idea-tag` wearing `idea-tag-due-urgent`,
`idea-tag-due-soon` or `idea-tag-due-later`, appended LAST to the row's badge strip — which is what puts it on
the right, since that strip is `justify-content: flex-end`. So this needs no new
column in `#idea-row` and nothing at all from `@rookery/core`. On a paged target the
same words render in parentheses after the stage, with no colour.

### `name-from:` — when the dated note is an instance of something else

**A tracker's dated note usually has no name of its own, and should not be given
one.** The durable note is the place — a conference series, a journal, a programme —
and the dated note is one attempt at it, carrying a valued tag that points back;
storing the title on both is how the two drift apart. So `name-from:` takes the TAG
KEY holding that pointer, and the row is named and linked by whatever it points at:

```typst
#upcoming(tags: "submission", today: NOW, name-from: "submission-of")
```

```
30.7.26   History and Philosophy of Computing (HaPoC)     SUBMITTED
 1.9.26   Cornell Society for the Humanities
```

rather than the opening words of each submission's own body, which is what rookery's
`label` falls back to for an untitled note.

The row links to the note it names — the durable one, which is what a reader clicking
a place's name wants, and which lists the dated note among its own backlinks anyway.
A pointer naming a note that does not exist falls back to the dated note's own name
silently: a missing target is an authoring gap in the corpus, and a view that panicked
over one typo would take a whole site down with it.

`name-from:` is a KEY, not a callback. There is no render hook here (see below), and
this stays on the declarative side of that line — the same register as `stage:`.

### `#upcoming-rows` — the same queue, as data

`#upcoming` is `#upcoming-rows` plus the drawing, and the row half is public because a
project may want the queue inside somebody else's widget:

```typst
#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": upcoming-rows
#import "@rookery/search:0.1.0": filter-panel

#filter-panel(
  rows: upcoming-rows(tags: "submission", within: 90, today: NOW),
  pills: ("sort-job", "sort-conference"),
  when: r => r.when,
)
```

It takes every argument `#upcoming` does except `title:`, `empty:` and `countdown:`
(which are about drawing), and returns the row dictionaries: rookery's own `ideas()`
fields plus `shown` (what to call the row), `link-to`, `when`, `firm`, `key` (the
zero-padded sort stamp), `at` (the stage reached) and `in-days`.

`in-days` is whole days until the row's date — negative where it is already behind
you, `none` where the row has no date at all. It ships on **every** row regardless of
`countdown:`, because this is the data half of the pair: a project rendering these
rows inside somebody else's widget draws its own urgency column and never calls
`#upcoming` at all.

**A project doing this must import `@rookery/search` in its own files.** rheo
scans only a project's own imports, never a package's — so if this package wrapped that
one for you, the panel's stylesheet and its script would never arrive and the widget
would render as an inert list with no explanation. That is also why the composition is
shaped this way round: rows here, rendering there, and no edge between the packages.

### What it deliberately is not

**It takes no ladder and cannot tell you a note is finished.** Whether `accepted`
ends a process is vocabulary this package refuses to own, for the reason
`is-settled` lives in `ladder.typ` and takes one as a parameter. A caller that wants
settled rows gone passes `filter:`:

```typst
#upcoming(tags: "submission", today: NOW, filter: t => not is-settled(t, ladder: JOB, today: NOW))
```

**Three fixed columns, and no render hook.** A fourth column — a submission's host
school, a path to a manuscript — is a question about the caller's own data model,
which this package cannot see; a project needing one keeps its own view. Fixed
columns are what make one call over two unrelated corpora read as one table.

`countdown:` is not an exception to that. It draws a fourth thing, but it asks the
caller for nothing: the words come from the log and the reference date, which this
view already holds and already sorts by. What the rule refuses is a column only the
caller can fill, because that is the one that stops two corpora looking like one
table. A countdown is the same column whatever the corpus.

On a paged or EPUB target there is no grid to align and no anchor to click, so the
same rows render as an ordinary list.

### Styling it

**The row is `#idea-row`, from `@rookery/core`.** Its cells and its chips are that
package's contract — `.idea-row`, `.idea-row-when` (with `.soft` where the date came
from a booked entry), `.idea-row-title`, `.idea-row-badges` holding `.idea-tag
idea-tag-<tag>` chips — and styling them once, there, is why every list in this family
now draws the same object. A themed stage colours its own chip through rookery's
generated `@layer rookery-tags` rules; this package names no hue at all.

What is this view's own: `.upcoming` on the wrapper, `.upcoming-title` on the label,
`.upcoming-list` on the list, `.upcoming-row` on each row alongside `.idea-row` (the
hook this package keeps, and where the rule between rows is drawn), and
`.upcoming-empty` for an empty result. The note's tags also ride on the row as
`idea-tag-<tag>` classes, so a project theming a tag on a card has already themed it
here.

The `countdown:` chip adds three classes of this view's own,
`.idea-tag-due-urgent`, `.idea-tag-due-soon` and `.idea-tag-due-later`, riding on an
otherwise ordinary `.idea-tag`.

Colours come from the rail's own properties (`--timeline-fg`, `--timeline-muted`,
`--timeline-line`), and there are four knobs of its own:

| | |
|---|---|
| `--upcoming-gutter` | the date column's width, forwarded to the shared row's `--idea-row-gutter` (defaults to `--timeline-gutter`'s 7.5em) |
| `--upcoming-due-urgent` | the countdown chip at today, tomorrow or overdue |
| `--upcoming-due-soon` | the same chip between two and seven days |
| `--upcoming-due-later` | the same chip between eight and fourteen days |

**The three due colours are one ramp, and the ramp is not this package's.** Each falls
back to `--rookery-heat-urgent` / `--rookery-heat-soon` / `--rookery-heat-later`
before it falls back to a literal (`#b3261e` / `#b3611e` / `#b38f1e`). Set those three
once on `:root` and every heat chip in the rookery family follows — this list's
countdown, and the due and priority chips `@rookery/todos` draws on a
`#filter-panel` row:

```css
:root {
  --rookery-heat-urgent: #9c3324;
  --rookery-heat-soon: #b05c12;
  --rookery-heat-later: #b08a10;
}
```

The `--upcoming-due-*` properties above are the per-view override, for a page that
wants this list to differ from everything else reading the ramp.

**There is a third route to those colours, and it wins over both.** The chip wears an
ordinary `idea-tag-<tag>` class, so theming `due-urgent`, `due-soon` or `due-later`
through
rookery's own `tags-color` colours it like any other tag — and those generated rules
live in `@layer rookery-tags`, declared after this package's layer, so a themed tag
beats the defaults above without needing to know they exist.

The list **flows down the page**: no `max-height`, no `overflow`, no scroll box. A
caller wanting fewer rows passes `limit:`, which is a claim about the data rather
than a lie about the height.

## Every date is author-supplied, and here is why

**Typst has no wall clock, and this package will not pretend otherwise.**

`datetime` carries no time of day at all — MEASURED, `datetime.today().hour()`
is `none`. Worse, `datetime.today()` returns **1980-01-01** wherever
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is set for reproducible builds, which is exactly what this
repository's own devShell exports (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=315532800`, MEASURED at
typst 0.15.1). It does not error. It answers wrongly and the build succeeds.

So:

- Nothing here is auto-stamped. You write the dates.
- **No function in this package calls `datetime.today()`**, and none should.
- Every predicate takes an explicit `today:`. With none given it falls back to
  the document's own `#set document(date: ..)` — and MEASURED, a document with
  no date yields `auto`, not `none`, so that case is tested for explicitly.
- With neither available it **panics**, naming the problem and both fixes.
  Defaulting to some arbitrary date would make "overdue" a silent lie, which is
  the failure mode this whole section exists to refuse.

If you generate notes programmatically, have the generator take `today()` from
its own environment and write the resulting literal into the `.typ`.

## Requirements

- `@rookery/core` 0.6.0, for `created` on an `#ideas()` row, for `tag-index`, and
  for the `ideas()` registry read `#upcoming` does. The CORE of this package imports
  it not at all — a tag fragment is a plain dictionary, and `dated(mint)` takes its
  constructor as an argument — but the `dated-idea` binding and `#upcoming` both do.
- No build step and no JavaScript. `typst.toml`'s `entrypoint` points straight at
  `src/`, so an edit takes effect immediately. It DOES ship one CSS file —
  `src/timeline.css`, for the two views that draw something
  (`#timeline-view` and `#upcoming`) — inside `@layer timeline`, so an
  unlayered rule in your own stylesheet beats it whatever the specificity.

## Development

```sh
cd timeline/0.1.0
just test
```
