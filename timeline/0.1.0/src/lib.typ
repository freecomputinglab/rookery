// @rookery/timeline — a dated log for rookery notes.
//
// A note's temporal planning, contributed through @rookery/core 0.6.0's TAG
// DICTIONARY rather than through a wrapper around `#idea`. The whole interface
// is a fragment builder you merge into a `tags:` argument:
//
//   #import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": dates
//   #idea("ship", tags: entries(deadline: datetime(year: 2026, month: 9, day: 1)))[..]
//
// THAT SHAPE IS THE POINT, and it survives 0.6.0's `#dated-idea` intact. The
// CORE of this package imports @rookery/core not at all, and @rookery/core knows
// nothing of it — a tag fragment is a plain dictionary, so composition needs no
// import relationship in either direction. Any package, and any hand-written
// `#idea`, can use it. `dated(mint)` keeps that true for the decorator too, by
// taking the minting function as an ARGUMENT; the single `dated-idea` binding at
// the foot of this file is the one line that imports rookery, and it exists only
// so the common case reads as one name rather than two.
//
// WHAT IT OWNS: a note's DATED EVENTS, as one ordered log. Until 0.6.0 it owned
// two independent slots and both were plans — `scheduled` (when you mean to work
// on it) and `deadline` (a hard date), the org-mode pair. A log is the third
// thing, org-mode's LOGBOOK to those two: what happened, and when. Both of the
// old slots are RESERVED STAGE NAMES inside it now, so one mechanism carries
// arbitrarily complex lifecycles without this package naming any of their states.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN, deliberately:
//
//   - `created`. Rookery core resolves and stores it and ships it on every
//     `ideas()` row. This package READS it (`created-of` below) rather than
//     keeping a second copy that could disagree — and core keeping it a ROW field
//     rather than a tag value is what makes filtering by date free, since a tag
//     value costs a `tag-data()` walk to reach.
//   - a STAGE VOCABULARY beyond the three reserved names. Whether `accepted` ends
//     a process or is the middle of it depends on words a consumer owns, so
//     `is-settled`/`rung`/`next-stage` take a ladder as a parameter. Status
//     transitions likewise: @rookery/todos owns `activated`.
//
//   `updated` is neither owned nor read — core removed that field in 0.6.0.
//   `updated-of` DERIVES it: the log's last entry, else `created`.
//
// THERE IS NO WALL CLOCK, and this constrains the whole package. Typst has no
// time of day at all (MEASURED: `datetime.today().hour()` is `none`), and in a
// reproducible-build environment `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` makes `datetime.today()`
// return 1980-01-01 rather than the real date (MEASURED at typst 0.15.1 with
// `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=315532800`, which is what this repo's own devShell sets).
// IT FAILS SILENTLY — a wrong date, not an error. So:
//
//   - every date is author-supplied; nothing here is auto-stamped
//   - NO FUNCTION IN THIS PACKAGE MAY CALL `datetime.today()`
//   - a predicate needing a "now" takes an explicit `today:`, falling back to
//     the document's own `#set document(date:)`, and panics rather than guess
//
// This package reads no rheo context, no `sys.inputs` and no state, and there is
// still no JavaScript. TWO functions are not pure functions of their arguments,
// and they are the two that DRAW something:
//
//   `#timeline-view` (`view.typ`) emits HTML — one note's log as a vertical rail —
//   which is why this package ships a stylesheet at all.
//
//   `#upcoming` (`upcoming.typ`) emits HTML AND READS THE NOTE REGISTRY, through
//   rookery's `ideas()`, because it draws one row per note across a whole corpus
//   and a caller cannot hand it that corpus as an argument. That is a real
//   widening of what this package touches, stated here rather than buried: it is
//   the same thing @rookery/todos' own views do, and nothing else here
//   follows it.

// ---- The SKIN over @rookery/core ------------------------------------------
//
// THE PATTERN. If you use plain rookery you import `idea`, `window` and the rest
// from rookery. If you use this package you import those SAME names from HERE
// instead, and get versions that take this package's date arguments. A skin over
// the default rather than a sidecar beside it.
//
//   #import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": idea, window, rookery
//   #idea("ship", deadline: d, timeline: (submitted: d2))[..]
//
// HOW IT WORKS, and all three facts were verified before this was written:
//
//   1. the star-import below RE-EXPORTS every rookery name to this module's own
//      consumers, so `window`, `ideas`, `tag-data`, `rookery` and the rest pass
//      through untouched and this file does not have to list them;
//   2. the aliased import keeps the ORIGINALS reachable, which is what lets a
//      decorated version call the thing it decorates;
//   3. a later top-level `#let` SHADOWS a star-imported name, so what this module
//      exports is the decorated one.
//
// WHAT IS OVERRIDDEN, and it is only these two. Everything else is rookery's,
// unchanged, and a consumer importing it from here gets exactly what it would get
// from there.
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": *
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0" as _rk

// A rookery note that also takes `timeline:`/`scheduled:`/`deadline:`.
#let idea = dated(_rk.idea)

// The FACTORY, decorated too, so a consumer building its own family over this skin
// — a `#submission`, a `#todo` — gets the date arguments without wrapping anything
// itself. Without this, every such family would call `dated(..)` around its own
// `tagged-idea(..)`, which is the boilerplate the skin exists to absorb.
#let tagged-idea(family) = dated(_rk.tagged-idea(family))

// KEPT AS AN ALIAS, and it is now the same function as `idea` above rather than the
// only way to get one. Call sites written before the skin keep working.
#let dated-idea = idea
