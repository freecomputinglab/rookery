// Ladder-driven derivations: is this finished, what comes next, how far did it
// get — with the VOCABULARY taken as a parameter rather than owned here.
//
// WHY A PARAMETER, and this is the whole design of the file. No package can know
// that `accepted` ENDS a conference submission and is the MIDDLE of a journal's
// ladder, or that `offered` ends a job application and `published` ends a paper.
// The words belong to the consumer; the reasoning belongs here. It is the same
// split this package already makes for `today:` — the caller supplies what only
// the caller can know, and the package refuses to guess.
//
// A LADDER is a plain dictionary with two arrays:
//
//   #let JOB = (
//     transit:  ("submitted", "longlisted", "first-interview",
//                "second-interview", "campus-visit", "finalist"),
//     terminal: ("offered", "rejected", "declined", "dropped", "missed"),
//   )
//
// `transit` is ORDERED BY PROGRESS, and that order is what `rung` reads.
// `terminal` is unordered in meaning — its membership is what settles a note.

#import "fragment.typ": *
#import "read.typ": *
#import "when.typ": *

// Validated on every call rather than once at construction, because a ladder is a
// plain dictionary a caller writes inline and there is no constructor to hang the
// check on. The checks are cheap and each catches something that fails SILENTLY
// otherwise.
// ---- A rung may name a FAMILY of stages ----------------------------------
//
// A rung ending in `-*` matches any stage sharing that prefix:
//
//   transit: ("submitted", "review-*", "accepted", "revision-*")
//
// `review-*` matches `review-1` and `review-12`, and NOT `reviewer` — the hyphen
// is part of the prefix — and not a bare `review` either, since that carries no
// occurrence and a lifecycle using the family form should say which one.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. A lifecycle with "a flexible number of reviews" cannot be written
// as a dict of stage names: MEASURED, a Typst dict rejects `(review: 1, review: 2)`
// outright with "duplicate key: review". So a repeated stage is written with
// numbered names, and a ladder has to be able to say "any review" rather than
// listing every occurrence anyone might reach.
//
// ONE FORM, AT ONE POSITION. A pattern is a prefix and nothing else: no `*` in the
// middle, no bare `*`, no character classes. Anything more is a glob implementation
// nobody asked for, and each addition is a new way for two rungs to overlap.
#let _is-family(pattern) = pattern.ends-with("-*")

// The prefix a family rung matches on, hyphen included, so `reviewer` cannot match
// `review-*`.
#let _family-prefix(pattern) = pattern.slice(0, pattern.len() - 1)

// What to CALL a rung — the pattern with its `-*` stripped, so a view drawing an
// expected rung shows `review` rather than `review *`. Exported because
// `#timeline-view` needs it and should not reimplement it.
#let rung-name(pattern) = {
  if _is-family(pattern) { pattern.slice(0, pattern.len() - 2) } else { pattern }
