// `#upcoming` — the log as a dated list ACROSS MANY NOTES.
//
// THE SECOND VIEW IN THIS PACKAGE, and the sibling of `#timeline-view` rather than
// a variant of it. That one draws ONE note's log as a rail; this draws ONE ROW PER
// NOTE, ordered by what is coming next. `view.typ`'s own header rejects an "inline
// sparkline (a different component, for a table of many notes)" — this is that
// different component, written rather than folded into the rail.
//
// WHAT MAKES IT BELONG HERE rather than in a consuming project: every question it
// asks is a question about a log. Which entry dates a row, whether that date has
// arrived, what has happened so far — all of it is `read.typ` and `when.typ`, and a
// project rewriting this view rewrites those readers' semantics by hand. The
// project this was extracted from had TWO copies of it (one over submissions, one
// over todos), which is the usual sign.
//
// TWO THINGS IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
//
//   NO LADDER. It cannot say whether a note is finished, because `accepted` ends a
//   conference submission and is the middle of a journal's — the same reason
//   `when.typ` keeps `is-settled` out of itself. A caller that wants settled rows
//   gone passes `filter:`.
//
//   NO RENDER HOOK, and so THREE FIXED COLUMNS: when, name, current stage. A
//   caller needing a fourth column (a submission's host school, a path to a
//   manuscript) is asking about ITS OWN data model, which this package cannot see,
//   and should keep its own view for that. Fixed columns are what make one call on
//   two unrelated corpora look like one table.
//
// THE ONE THING `countdown:` ADDS, and why it is not a breach of the rule above.
// It draws a fourth thing — a chip reading `in 5 days` — but it asks the CALLER
// for nothing: the words are computed from the log and the reference date, which
// is data this file already holds and already sorts by. What the fixed-columns
// rule refuses is a column only the caller can fill, because that is the one that
// makes two corpora stop looking like one table. A countdown is the same column
// whatever the corpus, so it stays a flag rather than becoming the render hook.
//
// THIS FILE READS THE NOTE REGISTRY, through rookery's `ideas()`. That makes it the
// second exception to `lib.typ`'s "every function is a function of its arguments",
// and a bigger one than `#timeline-view` (which only emits HTML). It is not a new
// pattern in the family: `@rookery/todos`' own views import `ideas` from
// rookery for exactly this.

#import "fragment.typ": *
#import "read.typ": *
#import "when.typ": *
// ALSO AS A MODULE, because `#upcoming`'s own `countdown:` flag shadows the
// `countdown` function this file calls: a parameter and a function of the same name
// cannot both be reachable by that name inside the view.
#import "when.typ" as _when

// The rookery spec is the one the sibling modules use — `lib.typ` names it twice
// and nothing else here imports rookery at all. Keep the three in step: a spec
// naming a version the cache cannot resolve fails with a bare "package not found"
// that says nothing about which file asked for it.
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": idea-row, ideas

// ---- when-of — which entry dates a row -------------------------------------
//
// PURE, and separate from the view for that reason: the view returns content and
// branches on `target()`, so nothing about it can be asserted on directly, while
// this is the whole of the policy and `test/units.typ` pins it.
//
// `stage:` is the caller's answer to "which entry queues this row", because the log
// is a DICTIONARY OF NAMED DATES and only the caller knows which name it is waiting
// on. A job application is queued by its `deadline`; a call whose dates are not out
// yet is queued by the `scheduled` date it is expected to post on; a conference is
// queued by whichever it has. So: one name, or an array of names in PRIORITY ORDER.
//
// THE LADDER, in order, and the second rung is the one worth stating:
//
//   1. the first of `stage:` the log carries -> that date, `firm: true`
//   2. else the next entry dated AFTER `today:` (`next-of`) -> `firm: false`
//   3. else nothing -> `(none, none, false)`, and the view sorts it last
//
// Rung 2 is the row with no deadline that nonetheless has something BOOKED — an
// interview, a promised decision. It has a real place in the queue and dropping it
// would hide the one thing about it that is imminent. `firm` marks it as answering
// the question from a different entry than the caller asked about; the stylesheet
// greys it, and it is a presentation fact rather than a claim about the date.
#let when-of(tags, stage: DEADLINE-STAGE, today: none) = {

// ---- #upcoming --------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `tags:`/`match:`/`filter:` are rookery's OWN selection vocabulary, passed
// straight through — `ideas()` asserts on the first two, and `filter:` is a
// predicate over the tag dictionary exactly as `#ideas-outline` and
// `#todos-list` take one. One idiom for selecting notes, not a second.
//
// `from:`/`within:` bound the WINDOW, and they bound it from opposite ends: `from`
// drops what is too old to matter, `within` drops what is too far off to act on.
// Neither drops an UNDATED row, which has no date to fail either test — a note
// being watched with nothing announced yet is precisely what a queue should still
// show.
//
// `name-from:` IS FOR A CORPUS WHERE THE DATED NOTE IS AN INSTANCE OF SOMETHING
// ELSE, which is the ordinary shape of a tracker: the durable note is the place —
// a conference series, a journal, a programme — and the dated note is one attempt at
// it, carrying a valued tag that points back. Such a note has no name of its own and
// should not be given one, because a title stored in two places drifts. So this takes
// the TAG KEY holding the pointer, and the row is named and linked by whatever it
// points at. Without it, a row is named by its own note, which is the right answer
// whenever the dated note IS the thing.
//
// A KEY, NOT A CALLBACK: there is no render hook here on purpose (see the header),
// and this stays on the declarative side of that line — the same register as
// `stage:`, which also names a key rather than computing anything.
//
// SORTED ASCENDING, oldest first, which puts a date already behind you at the TOP
// rather than the bottom. An overdue row is the most urgent thing on the list.
//
// `countdown:` DRAWS HOW LONG YOU HAVE, off by default. With it on, a row whose
// date falls within a fortnight gains a chip on the right reading `today`,
// `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, `in 5 days` or `9 days ago`. Three bands: today,
// tomorrow and anything overdue are `urgent`; two to seven days is `soon`; eight to
// fourteen is `later`; anything further off, or undated, draws nothing at all.
// The bands are fixed (`countdown`, `when.typ`); their colours are the
// `--rookery-heat-*` ramp in this package's stylesheet, and a project may also theme
// `due-urgent`/`due-soon`/`due-later` through rookery's own `tags-color`, because
// the chip wears an ordinary `idea-tag-<tag>` class like any other.
//
// IT IS THE LAST BADGE IN THE STRIP, which is what puts it on the right: rookery's
// `.idea-row-badges` is `justify-content: flex-end`, so the final chip is the
// row's rightmost element. That is also why this needs no new column in
// `#idea-row` and no change to @rookery/core at all.
//
// ---- #upcoming-rows — the queue as DATA -------------------------------------
//
// SPLIT OUT AND PUBLIC, and not merely as tidiness: it is what lets a project put an
// upcoming queue INSIDE a filter widget —
// `#filter-panel(rows: upcoming-rows(..), when: r => r.when)` — without this package
// importing @rookery/search. It must not: rheo scans only a PROJECT's own
// imports, never a package's, so a timeline that wrapped search's panel would hand a
// project markup with neither that package's stylesheet nor its script, silently.
// Computing rows here and rendering them there costs no package edge, because the
// project names both packages itself.
//
// Every argument means exactly what it means on `#upcoming`, which is now this plus
// the rendering. Returns the row dictionaries: rookery's own `ideas()` fields, plus
// `shown` (what to call it), `link-to`, `when`, `firm`, `key` (the sort stamp),
// `at` (the stage reached) and `in-days` (whole days until the row's date,
// negative where it is overdue and `none` where it has no date).
//
// ---- `today:` IS REQUIRED HERE, and only here --------------------------------
//
// The predicates in `when.typ` resolve a missing `today:` through `_today` — the
// explicit argument, else the document's own `#set document(date:)`, else a panic.
// THESE TWO VIEWS DO NOT. They assert on the argument itself and take no document
// date, which is a deliberate narrowing rather than an oversight.
//
// The reason is what a QUEUE claims. A predicate answers a question the caller
// asked; a queue asserts an ordering, a window and a set of stage badges, all of
// which read as facts about the reader's today. A document date the author set
// once and stopped thinking about would make every one of them silently wrong
// rather than visibly absent. So the reference date is named at the call site,
// where it can be seen.
