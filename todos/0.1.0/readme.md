# @rookery/todos

Todos, epics and a dependency DAG over [`@rookery/core`](../../core/0.1.0) notes.

```typst
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": rookery
#import "@rookery/todos:0.1.0": todo, todos-ready, todo-graph-view
#show: rookery

#let TODAY = datetime(year: 2026, month: 8, day: 25)

#todo("fetch", title: [Fetch the source], priority: 0, done: datetime(year: 2026, month: 8, day: 1))[...]
#todo("parse", title: [Parse it], priority: 1, type: "bug", deps: ("fetch",))[...]

#todos-ready(today: TODAY)
#todo-graph-view(today: TODAY)
```

A todo is an ordinary rookery note carrying a `todo` tag. **Nothing is stored
anywhere else** — the registry rookery already keeps *is* the todo database, and
every view here is derived from it at build time.

## What this is, and what it is not

This simulates much of the useful surface of [`br`](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads),
the beads issue tracker. The framing that decides what made it in:

> **br is a mutable SQLite database; this is a static build.**

So this package ports br's **derived views** and not its **mutation surface**.
A status change here is an edit to a `.typ` file, which is the point rather than
a shortcoming.

| `br` | here | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `br list` | `#todos-list(..)` | ✅ |
| `br search` | `#todos-search(..)` | ✅ in-page filter |
| `br ready` | `#todos-ready(today: ..)` | ✅ |
| `br blocked` | `#todos-blocked()` | ✅ |
| `br stale` | `#todos-stale(today: .., older-than: ..)` | ✅ |
| `br stats` / `count` | `#todos-stats(today: ..)` | ✅ |
| `br graph` | `#todo-graph-view(today: .., closed: ..)` | ✅ |
| `br epic` | `#epic(name)` | ✅ as a tag, not a tree |
| `br create` | `#todo(..)` | ✅ |
| `br update` / `close` / `dep add` | — | edit the `.typ` |
| `br comments` | — | the note's body |
| `br dep --type parent-child` | — | see "No parent edges" |
| `pinned`, `ephemeral`, `compaction_*`, `source_*`, `agent_context` | — | beads infrastructure |

## Closing a todo

Three spellings, one log entry — the third and the second fold into the first
before anything reads them, so they cannot disagree:

```typst
#todo("fetch", timeline: (closed: d))[...]   // the store, written directly
#todo("fetch", done: d)[...]                 // the shorthand
#let shipped = done(d)                       // the factory, for a shared date
#shipped("fetch", priority: 0)[...]
```

- **A close is a DATE.** `done: true` is refused with a message: a log entry
  needs a date, and nothing here auto-stamps one because there is no clock to
  stamp from — `datetime.today()` returns 1980-01-01 under a reproducible-build
  `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` and fails silently while doing it.
- **`done:` takes whatever a log entry takes**, so a close can carry its own
  prose: `done: (timestamp: d, note: [Landed as ..])`.
- **`#done(date)` is a factory**, the same shape as `#epic(name)`: it returns a
  `#todo` variant with `done:` bound and keeps the entire call surface —
  content bodies, all three id forms, `priority`, `deps`, `tags`, a further
  `timeline:` of other stages. It curries rather than taking the date as a
  leading positional argument because `#todo`'s first positional is the note's
  ID, and a date there would take that slot.
- **Closing twice is refused** — `done:` together with `timeline: (closed: ..)`
  leaves the date the todo closed on unknowable, so write one of them.

## 0.1.0 — a todo's dates are one log

The first release of this package, version-aligned with `@rookery/core`,
`@rookery/search` and `@rookery/timeline`; an alpha lineage up to
0.6.0 preceded it and has been retired. The one thing worth carrying forward
from it is the shape of a todo's dates, because a project coming off the alpha
has call sites to change.

A todo has a lifecycle — filed, scheduled, activated, closed — and it used to be
spread across three owners: rookery core's `minted`/`updated`,
`@rookery/timeline`'s two date keys, and this package's own valued
`todo-closed`. That last one was a dated event wearing a tag's clothes. Every
date a todo carries now lives in one timeline, and a close REQUIRES a
`datetime` — `closed: true` is refused:

```typst
#todo("ship", deadline: d, timeline: (activated: d2, closed: d3))[...]
```

- **`#todo` takes `scheduled:`, `deadline:` and `timeline:` as named arguments**, being
  built on rookery-timeline's `dated(..)` decorator. The old `tags: entries(deadline: d)`
  form still works and is still supported.
- **The `closed:` ARGUMENT is gone**, and a close is a log entry: write it as
  `timeline: (closed: d)` or as the `done: d` shorthand above. `closed: true`
  used to mean "closed, when unknown"; an entry needs a date, and this package
  has no clock to stamp one from, so an undated close is simply a caller who did
  not say when. The message says so.
- **`todo-closed` survives as a FLAT marker** carrying no date. See surface 2
  below for why that is not a second copy.
- **`activated` joins the vocabulary** — the moment a todo went from ready to
  being worked on. rookery-timeline reserves `scheduled`/`deadline`/`closed` and
  leaves the rest to its consumers; a status transition is this package's to name.
- **`#todos-stale` now measures activity rather than document age.** It read
  core's `updated`, which fell back to the DOCUMENT's date — so on any project
  that did not hand-write an `updated:` per todo, "stale" reported how old the
  document was. It reads the log's last entry now.
- **`updated:` is gone from `#idea`**, so passing it to `#todo` does nothing —
  and does it silently, since the argument lands in `#idea`'s positional sink
  rather than erroring. Rookery removed the field.

Migrating: change every `closed: true` to `done: <the date it closed>`, and every
`closed: <datetime>` to `done: <datetime>`. If you read `closed-on`, it now comes
from the log; if you filtered on `tags:todo-closed`, that still works.

## A skin over rookery

Same pattern as `@rookery/timeline`, one layer further out: import `idea`,
`window` and the rest **from here** and get versions that know about todos.

```typst
#import "@rookery/todos:0.1.0": idea, rookery, todo, window
```

It imports the **timeline skin**, not rookery directly, so the decoration composes:
`idea` arriving here is already `dated(rookery.idea)`, and a note written through
this package takes the log arguments as well as the todo ones.

**`window` is the one name this layer overrides.** A closed todo is not transcluded:

```typst
#window("some-todo")                // renders nothing if that todo is closed
#window("some-todo", closed: true)  // opts it back in
```

A closed todo windowed into a page is noise — the thing is done, and the reason to
window a todo at all is to have it in front of you.

**Only the NAMED case is filtered**, and that is a limitation rather than an
oversight. `#window` takes either a name or a `tags:`/`match:` selection. Given a
name, this wrapper reads that note's tags and decides. Given a selection, rookery
does the selecting internally and `tags:`/`match:` are any/all over a list with **no
negation** — so a wrapper cannot express "todo and not closed", and a tag-selected
window still shows closed todos. Fixing that needs a negation or a predicate hook in
rookery's own tag predicate, not a workaround here.

**A closed todo is also greyed where it is hatched**, not only in a list view. It
needs nothing new from rookery: `.idea-box` and a note's heading already carry
`idea-tag-<key>` for every tag key, so the closed marker is on the card as a class.
The card recedes as a whole via `opacity` — one property rather than a rule per part
— and hovering restores it, since a closed todo is receded and not hidden. Override
`--todo-closed-opacity` to taste.

## The three tag surfaces

This is the whole design of the package. Read it before adding an attribute.

**1. Flat, key encodes the value.** Value `none`, so each renders as a pill,
emits a `.idea-tag-<key>` class, and is filterable by rookery's own
`#window(tags:)`/`#ideas(tags:)` *and* by `@rookery/search`'s tag query
language.

| key | from |
| --- | --- |
| `todo` | every todo |
| `todo-p0` … `todo-p4` | `priority:` (0 = critical, br's scale) |
| `todo-task`, `todo-bug`, `todo-feature`, `todo-epic`, `todo-chore`, `todo-docs`, `todo-question` | `type:` |
| `todo-in-progress`, `todo-deferred`, `todo-draft` | `status:` |
| `epic-<name>` | `#epic(name)` |

The payoff is concrete and costs this package nothing: **`tags:todo&!todo-closed`
in a search bar lists open todos**, with no rookery-todos code involved.

**2. Valued.** No pill, but the KEY is still present, so a valued tag is still
presence-filterable — `#window(tags: "todo-deps")` finds every todo with
dependencies.

| key | value |
| --- | --- |
| `todo-deps` | array of note names |
| `todo-metadata` | dictionary — estimate, assignee, close-reason, external-ref, … |

**`todo-closed` moved to surface 1 in 0.6.0**, and it is worth saying why it did
not simply disappear. The DATE a todo closed lives in the log, with every other
dated event in its life — that is the whole point of 0.6.0. But rookery's tag
predicate and rookery-search's `tags:` query both test KEYS, so a fact living only
inside a tag's VALUE is invisible to them, and `tags:todo&!todo-closed` — the
payoff named at the top of surface 1 — would have been lost to buy tidiness.

So `todo-closed` is now a FLAT presence marker valued `none`, carrying no date and
duplicating nothing. `is-closed` reads either it or a `closed` entry in the log, so
a note written straight through `entries(timeline: (closed: d))` without `#todo` still
reads as closed; `closed-on` reads only the log, the one place the date is stored.
`closed: false` still emits no key at all.

**3. Not tags of ours at all.**

- **Labels are plain, unnamespaced rookery tags.** `#todo("x", tags: ("phd",))`.
  A todo's labels *are* rookery tags, and namespacing them would break exactly
  the filtering and theming that is the point.
- **Dates come from [`@rookery/timeline`](../../timeline/0.1.0)** —
  `#todo("x", deadline: d, timeline: (activated: d2))`, or the older
  `#todo("x", tags: entries(deadline: d))`. One concept, one package, and as of
  0.6.0 one log.
- **`created` is rookery core's own**, forwarded straight through `#todo`. There
  is no `updated` beside it any more; `updated-of(row, tags)` in rookery-timeline
  derives last-touched from the log instead.

## Rows as windows: `windows:`

`todos-list`, `todos-ready`, `todos-blocked` and `todos-stale` each take
`windows: false`. Set it and every row renders as a folded
[`#window`](../../core/0.1.0) — the todo's own body, one click away, in place —
instead of a link to its minted page.

```typst
#todos-ready(today: TODAY, windows: true)
```

**It defaults to `false`**, so nothing changes for an existing project: with the
flag unset the views emit exactly the markup they did before.

**Paged and EPUB targets fall back to the link list.** A PDF has no fold to
click, so a window row there would be a heading with a body under it and no way
to tell it from the surrounding prose. That is a deliberate branch, not a gap.

**Why the flag lives here rather than in your project:** `ready` and `blocked`
are derived from the dependency graph and the calendar, never stored as tags, so
no `#window(tags: ..)` selection can express them. Only code that has already
computed the rows can hand `#window` the names.

### Backlinks

A `windows: true` view gives every todo it lists a backlink from the page
holding the view — the note's own page lists that page under "Context", exactly
as it would for a `#window` you wrote by hand.

That is worth knowing before putting one on a busy index: a page listing twenty
ready todos becomes a backlink on all twenty. It is not suppressible, and should
not be — the view really does reference those notes, and hiding that from the
backlink walk would make the walk lie.

This needed a fix in `@rookery/core` 0.5.0 to work at all. The backlink walk
reads a page's content at template time, which cannot enter a `context` block,
and these views must run inside one; a window emitted from there used to
announce itself to nobody. rookery now labels `#window`'s announce marker and
collects those by `query()` instead, which sees them wherever they were
written.

A TAG-SELECTED window is still the exception: `#window(tags: ..)` produces no
backlink for the notes its tag matched, only for ones named outright. That
asymmetry is rookery's and is documented there.

## Filtering todos in the page: `#todos-search`

```typst
#todos-search(today: TODAY)
```

A text input that fuzzy-filters the todos as you type, with the matches listed
below it as **links to each todo's minted page**, and a row of toggleable pills
that refine the set further.

```typst
#todos-search(
  title: none,
  placeholder: "Filter todos",
  today: none,
  closed: false,
)
```

`closed: false` is the default here, unlike `#todos-list` where it is `true`: a
filter box is for finding live work.

**The pills** are `ready`, `blocked`, and one per todo *type* any listed todo
actually has — no pill is emitted for a type nothing carries, since that filter
could only ever return nothing. Within a facet the values **OR** (two status
pills mean either); across facets they **AND** (`blocked` + `docs` leaves todos
that are both).

`ready` and `blocked` are stamped into each row at build time, computed against
the whole dependency graph. That is also why this widget is here rather than in
`@rookery/search`: both are derived from the graph and the calendar and
deliberately never stored as tags, so no tag query can select them.

**Searching covers the body, not just the title** — the haystack is the title,
the name and the body, so typing a phrase from inside a todo finds it.

### Without JavaScript

The input and the pills are hidden and every todo is listed as an ordinary
link. Nothing is fetched or built in the browser: Typst emits every row up
front and the script only shows, hides and reorders them. A paged or EPUB
target gets the plain list too.

### When you want the whole rookery instead

Use [`@rookery/search`](../../search/0.1.0). This filters *the todos on
this page*; that searches every note in the rookery, with a proper ranking and
a modal. The two are independent — this package does not depend on it, and a
project may install either alone.

## Grouped pills: `#filter-panel`

The other filter box, and it is `@rookery/search`'s `#panel` told about the todo
graph — the same name that package exports, re-exported here with pills that know
what `ready` and `blocked` mean. A site star-importing both gets this one as long as
it imports `@rookery/todos` **last**.

```typst
#filter-panel(today: TODAY)
```

**Four pill groups, none of them declared:** `epic` and `tag` on the first line,
`state` and `priority` on the second under a `todo states:` label. The first pair
says what a todo is *about*, the second how far along it is. Within a group the
values **OR**; across groups they **AND** — so `blocked` + `p1` leaves blocked
priority-one todos, where `#todos-search`'s single undifferentiated pill row could
only ever union.

**The `tag` group is every plain tag the listed todos carry**, and that is the point
of it: put a new tag on one todo and its pill is there on the next build, with no
list to maintain anywhere. It is a `multi:` facet in `#panel`'s sense — a row holds a
*set* of tags, so pressing two tags widens the list and a row carrying either
survives.

What it leaves out, all of it a fact another group already states:

- **Valued keys** — `timeline-log`, `todo-deps`, a site's own `cfp-venue`. That is
  the three tag surfaces above doing the work: the flat surface is the one that
  renders as a pill, and a valued key holds a date, a URL or an id, which a reader
  filters by key rather than wears as a name.
- **`todo` and `todo-*`** — `state` and `priority` decode those properly. A `todo`
  pill would select every row there is.
- **`epic-*`, and the bare tag whose `epic-<tag>` is also present.** A site minting a
  todo under an epic writes both keys, so without this the epic's name would sit in
  two groups at once — and pressing it in one but not the other reads as a
  contradiction, groups ANDing across.

**Tags are not chipped on the row**, unlike the other three facets, and that is a
decision about the grid: `.idea-row` is `<gutter> 1fr auto auto` and the badge strip
is that last `auto`, so a chip per tag makes the strip as wide as the widest row's
tag list and squeezes every title on the page to pay for it. Each row still wears
every tag as an `.idea-tag-<tag>` class, so theming by tag is unaffected.

**To keep a whole tag family out of the group**, pass `tag-filter:` — a predicate over
the tag key, which narrows the group and cannot widen it:

```typst
#filter-panel(
  today: TODAY,
  tag-filter: k => not k.starts-with("venue-") and not k.starts-with("sort-"),
)
```

A predicate rather than a list of names, because the group's whole value is that
nothing declares it: a list of tags to exclude is the same maintenance burden back
again, one entry per tag instead of one per pill. What a site wants to drop is a
*family*, and its families are its own — `venue-*` and `sort-*` here, some other
scheme on the next site. The package's own four rules above run first regardless, so a
`tag-filter` returning `true` for `timeline-log` still gets no pill.

Pass `facets:` to narrow the groups (`facets: ("epic", "state", "priority")` is the
row this had before the tag group), and `state-label: none` to put every group back
on one line.

## Derived, never stored

`blocked`, `ready` and `stale` are questions about the graph and the calendar as
they stand right now, not facts about a note. Tagging them would let them drift
out of step with the deps and dates that define them, and nothing would report
the drift.

`is-ready` is open **and** unblocked **and** not deferred past the reference
date. The deferral clause is what makes it br's `ready` rather than merely "not
blocked" — a todo scheduled for next week is not work you can pick up now.

`stale` changed meaning in 0.6.0 and is now worth the name. It used to read
rookery core's `updated`, which resolved from the DOCUMENT's date when a todo did
not carry one of its own — so on most projects it measured how old the document
was rather than whether anything had happened. It reads the todo's own log now:
touching a todo puts an entry in it, and that is what "untouched" is measured
against.

## No parent edges

Todos are networked **purely** through `deps:`. There is no `todo-parent` key
and no containment tree.

An epic is therefore a tag, not a parent: `#epic("launch")` returns a `#todo`
variant with `epic-launch` bound, and two todos in one epic are unrelated until
one names the other in its `deps:`.

```typst
#let launch = epic("launch")
#launch("plan", priority: 1)[Kick-off.]
#launch("post", deps: ("plan",))[Follows the plan.]
```

The factory keeps `#todo`'s entire call surface — content bodies, all three
`#idea` id forms, every named argument.

## A cycle is a build error

...but it **cannot** be caught at the `#todo` call site, and it is worth knowing
why. `#todo("a", deps: ("b",))` is perfectly legal before `b` exists; the graph
only exists once the registry is final. There is no moment during authoring at
which a cycle is visible.

So the guarantee is assembled from two halves:

- **Every view** runs the cycle check before rendering and panics, naming the
  full path: `dependency cycle: c -> d -> c`.
- **`#todos-validate()`** does the same for a project that renders no view.
  Drop it at bundle root.

Between them a cycle cannot survive a build.

`#todos-validate()` also reports what cannot be a warning: **Typst gives package
code no `warn()`**, only `panic`. So the dangling-dependency and auto-id smells
are emitted into the compiled output (hidden by default) rather than failing a
build that has not actually broken. Pass `strict: true` to turn them into errors.

**Pin any todo something else depends on.** Rookery's unnamed notes take a
sequence number, so `#todo[..]` is `idea:1` — and that number *shifts* when a
note is inserted earlier in the spine, while a `deps` entry naming it does not
follow.

## There is no wall clock

Every view needing a "now" takes an explicit `today:`, falling back to the
document's `#set document(date:)`, and panics if neither is available.

**No function in this package calls `datetime.today()`.** It returns
1980-01-01 wherever `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is set for reproducible builds
(MEASURED, typst 0.15.1) and it does not error while doing it — a stale-todo
report built on it would silently list the entire project.
`@rookery/timeline`' readme carries the full evidence.

## Styling

Everything ships in `@layer todos`, and that is load-bearing. Package
stylesheet order is **not** controllable — rheo collects `css_stylesheet` assets
in package resolution order — so this package cannot rely on landing after
rookery's. A layer settles it regardless of source order, the same device
rookery uses for `@layer rookery-tags`. An unlayered project stylesheet still
beats every layer.

Colours are custom properties with fallbacks, so restyle by setting the property
rather than by out-specifying a selector: `--todo-ready-color`,
`--todo-blocked-color`, `--todo-stale-color`, `--todo-muted-color`,
`--todo-graph-line`, `--todo-graph-edge-color`.

Rows and graph nodes also wear the note's own `.idea-tag-<key>` classes, so
`.idea-tag-todo-p0` styles a critical todo on its card, in a list row, and in
the graph alike.

### The heat ramp: how close, and how urgent

`#filter-panel` **bands the date cell itself** on every row whose date falls within a
fortnight, in the three bands `@rookery/timeline` defines (`countdown`,
`when.typ`): urgent is today, tomorrow and anything overdue; soon is two to seven
days; later is eight to fourteen. The colour is the reading at a glance; the words —
`today`, `tomorrow`, `in 5 days`, `9 days ago` — ride as a tooltip drawn above the
cell on hover and on focus, and as its `aria-label` for a reader who cannot see a
colour. The badge strip stays about facets.

It is **on by default** here, where `#upcoming`'s own `countdown:` is off, because a
panel of outstanding work is read for what is due next. Pass `countdown: false` to
drop it, and note that it needs a `today:` — with none passed no row can be measured
and no countdown band is drawn. (`#upcoming` is untouched: that view keeps its chips.)

**Priority is the fallback, and only where the countdown is silent.** A todo three
weeks out earns no countdown band, so a `p0` sitting far out would otherwise read
exactly like the `p4` beside it; where both could apply the countdown wins, because a
deadline actually due soon is the more pressing read regardless of how it was
prioritised. `p0` takes the urgent hue, `p1` soon, `p2` later, each a touch lighter
than the countdown band of the same colour. `p3` and `p4` are left plain — a ramp of
three has three steps, and a backlog item colouring itself is the noise the ramp
exists to cut through. A row with no date is never banded: a wash behind an em dash
says nothing.

| | |
|---|---|
| `--rookery-heat-urgent` | the whole family's first step (defaults to `#b3261e`) |
| `--rookery-heat-soon` | its second (defaults to `#b3611e`) |
| `--rookery-heat-later` | its third (defaults to `#b38f1e`) |
| `--todo-band-urgent` / `--todo-band-soon` / `--todo-band-later` | the countdown wash on the date cell, overriding the mix of the ramp |
| `--todo-band-p0` / `--todo-band-p1` / `--todo-band-p2` | the priority wash, same |
| `--todo-band-fg` | the ink on a banded `soft` date, which is no longer greyed |
| `--todo-tooltip-bg` / `--todo-tooltip-fg` / `--todo-tooltip-border` / `--todo-tooltip-outline` | the drawn tooltip, falling back to rookery's own `--idea-*` |

**One ramp, two readings, and by default they are the same palette.** A site sets the
three `--rookery-heat-*` properties once on `:root` and every heat surface in the
family follows — this package's six date bands, and `#upcoming`'s countdown chips over
in `@rookery/timeline`. The `--todo-band-*` properties exist for the site that
wants urgency-in-time and urgency-in-priority to read differently, and each replaces
its band's colour whole rather than feeding a mix:

```css
:root {
  --rookery-heat-urgent: #9c3324;
  --rookery-heat-soon: #b05c12;
  --rookery-heat-later: #b08a10;
  /* ...and, only if the two should come apart: */
  --todo-band-p0: color-mix(in oklab, #6a3ab2 34%, transparent);
}
```

## The graph view degrades

**`closed: false` draws the open todos only.** An index page asking "what is
left" wants exactly that; the finished half of a release otherwise fills the
graph and the remaining work is hard to find. The default is `true`, so an
existing call is unchanged.

Edges go with the boxes: an edge into a closed todo is a *satisfied* dependency,
and drawing it would point at a box that is not on the page. A dangling
dependency — one naming a note that does not exist — is still named in the
fallback list, because it never had a box in any slice.

**Status is still computed against the whole graph**, never the slice. A todo
whose only dependency is closed reads as `ready`, which is the truth; asking the
filtered graph would report it unblocked *because invisible* rather than
unblocked *because done* — the right answer for the wrong reason, and the wrong
answer as soon as a deferred or dangling dep is involved.

`graph-slice(graph, closed: ..)` is exported if you are building your own view
and want the same rows and edges.

**The drawing reads top-down: unblocked work on the top row, arrows running
down to what it unblocks.** So an arrow means *"unblocks"*, not *"depends on"* —
the reverse of how the `deps:` you write points. That is a drawing decision
only: `deps:` in the Typst API and `from`/`to` in the JSON payload both still
describe the dependency, unchanged.

Pair it with `closed: false` and the top row is exactly the ready work.

`#todo-graph-view` emits an SVG drawn client-side from a JSON payload. With
JavaScript off the payload's neighbouring linked list stays in place, so the
todos and their dependencies are still readable; the script removes the
fallback only once it has drawn something.

**On a paged target that same list is the whole rendering.** Every view here
branches on the target: HTML and EPUB get `html.elem` markup, and a PDF gets
plain Typst content — a `list()` of rows for the lists, a comma-joined line for
the stats, and the graph's fallback list for the graph, since there is no
layout engine for a directed graph Typst-side. Counts are computed once and
rendered twice, so the two targets cannot disagree.

The payload is JSON-safe by construction: strings, numbers, booleans and arrays
only, never a raw tag value. A value can be a `datetime` or content, and
`json.encode` of content does **not** error — it silently emits a structural
blob and bloats the page.

## Requirements

- `@rookery/core` 0.6.0 and `@rookery/timeline` 0.6.0. Both are hard imports.
- rheo 0.6.0 or later, inherited from rookery's own floor.
- A built package: `dist/` must exist before a project sees an edit.

## Development

```sh
cd todos/0.1.0
