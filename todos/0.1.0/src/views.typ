// The rendered views — br's derived reports, as HTML over the graph.
//
// Every view here answers a question br answers with a subcommand: `todos-list`
// is `br list`, `todos-ready` is `br ready`, `todos-blocked` is `br blocked`,
// `todos-stale` is `br stale`, `todos-stats` is `br stats`. What is NOT here is
// br's MUTATION surface — `update`, `close`, `dep add` — because a status
// change in a static build is an edit to a `.typ` file.
//
// TWO RULES EVERY VIEW FOLLOWS:
//
//  1. It runs the cycle check before rendering. A cyclic graph has no order to
//     present, and this is half of what makes a cycle impossible to ship (the
//     other half is `#todos-validate()` for a project that renders no view).
//  2. It takes `today:` where it needs a reference date, and never calls
//     `datetime.today()`. That returns 1980-01-01 under a reproducible build
//     and DOES NOT ERROR — a stale-todo report built on it would silently list
//     the whole project. @rookery/timeline resolves `today:` against the
//     document date and panics when neither is available.

// ---- _windows — the same rows, as folded transclusions --------------------
//
// `#todos-*(windows: true)` renders each row as a folded `#window` instead of a
// link, so a reader unfolds a todo's body in place rather than clicking through
// to its minted page.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN THE PACKAGE and not in a caller: `ready` and `blocked` are
// DERIVED from the dependency graph and the calendar (`is-ready`, `is-blocked`
// in `graph.typ`), never stored as tags — so no `#window(tags: ..)` selection
// can express them. Only code that has already computed the rows can hand
// `#window` the names, and that code is here.
//
// ONE `#window` CALL PER ROW, not one array call. `#window` does accept an
// array of names, and that form would cost one registry read instead of N —
// but it cannot interleave the per-row `trailing` note, and that note is the
// entire value of `#todos-blocked` ("blocked by X, Y"). The per-row cost is
// what `#window` already costs everywhere else it is used.
// THESE WINDOWS DO PRODUCE BACKLINKS, and that took a rookery fix. The backlink
// walk reads a page's content at `#show: rookery` time, which cannot enter a
// `context` block — and these views must run inside one, since the graph and
// the reference date resolve nowhere else. A window emitted from here therefore
// announced itself to nobody, and every note the view unfolded lost its
// backlink from the page unfolding it. MEASURED, then fixed in rookery by
// labelling `#window`'s announce marker and collecting those by `query()`,
// which sees them wherever the window was written.
//
// So a `windows: true` view is a real reference and shows up as one. Documented
// in the readme, because a busy index becomes a backlink on everything it
// lists.
#let _windows(title, rows, empty, trailing: r => none) = {
