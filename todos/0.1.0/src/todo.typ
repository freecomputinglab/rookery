// `#todo` — the package's primitive, an `#idea` variant carrying todo tags.

#import "tags.typ": *

// A todo is a rookery note tagged `todo`, plus whatever `todo-tags` folds in.
//
//   #todo("build", priority: 1, type: "bug", deps: ("fetch",))[Fix the parser.]
//   #todo[A frictionless todo — takes an auto id, same as `#idea`.]
//
// Built on rookery's `tagged-idea` factory rather than on `#idea` directly, so
// the `todo` tag is PREPENDED and merged rather than replacing a caller's own
// `tags:`. `..args` is forwarded untouched, which is what keeps all three
// `#idea` call forms working — `#todo[body]`, `#todo("name")[body]` and
// `#todo(<name>)[body]` — along with every `#idea` named argument this wrapper
// does not itself consume: `title`, `level`, `created`, `show-date`,
// `show-tags`.
//
// EVERY DATE A TODO CARRIES BELONGS TO @rookery/timeline, in its entirety.
// `#todo` is built on that package's `dated(..)` decorator, so `scheduled:`,
// `deadline:` and `timeline:` are its named arguments passed straight through:
//
//   #todo("ship", deadline: d, timeline: (activated: d2, closed: d3))[..]
//
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE IS, stated plainly because the boundary moved: a LIFECYCLE
// declared over @rookery/timeline. It contributes the stage names `activated`
// and `closed` (see `ACTIVATED-STAGE` and that package's `CLOSED-STAGE`), the
// `TODO-LADDER` that orders them, its own tag family, and the views. It owns NO
// dates: the log, the readers, the derivations over a ladder and the rail that
// draws one all live there, and a todo is one vocabulary among several — a
// submission tracker declares another over the same machinery.
//
// `done:` IS THE SHORTHAND FOR ONE CLOSE, and it is sugar over that same log:
//
//   #todo("ship", done: d)               ==  #todo("ship", timeline: (closed: d))
//
// It takes whatever a log entry takes, so an entry dictionary works here too and
// is how a close carries its own prose: `done: (timestamp: d, note: [Landed as ..])`.
//
// So there is still ONE store and one write path — `done:` folds into the
// `timeline:` dictionary before anything reads it (`_closing` below), rather than
// setting a second flag beside it. That is the whole reason the old `closed:`
// argument was removed in 0.6.0: it wrote the flat marker while
// `timeline: (closed: d)` wrote the entry, and the two disagreed. Folding cannot
// disagree.
//
// IT TAKES A DATE, NOT A BOOL. `done: true` is refused with a message, because a
// log entry needs a date and there is no clock here to stamp one from — see the
// `created` note below and rookery-timeline's own header for the measured
// evidence. Giving the same stage twice — `done:` and `timeline: (closed: ..)`
// together — is refused for the same reason rookery-timeline refuses it: which
// date the author meant is unknowable.
//
// `#done(d)` (below) is the same close as a FACTORY, for a date several todos
// share — see its own comment for why the date cannot lead a positional list.
//
// The old form still works and is still supported — `dated` merges its fragment
// into whatever `tags:` the caller passed — so `#todo("ship", tags: entries(deadline: d))`
// is unchanged:
//
//   #todo("ship", tags: entries(deadline: d))[..]
//
// `created` is rookery's own row field, forwarded through `..args`. There is no
// `updated`: rookery removed it in 0.6.0 and rookery-timeline derives last-touched
// from the log. Nothing in this package auto-stamps a date; there is no wall
// clock to stamp from (see rookery-timeline's readme for the measured evidence).
//
// A CLOSE IS A DATE however it is written — `done:` or `timeline: (closed: ..)` —
// and it goes into the log rather than onto a valued tag. See `CLOSED-KEY` in
// `tags.typ` for why the flat marker stays beside it.
//
// AN AUTO-ID DEP IS FRAGILE, and this package cannot warn you about it here.
// Rookery's unnamed notes take a sequence number from a counter, so `#todo[..]`
// is `idea:1` — and that number SHIFTS when a note is inserted earlier in the
// spine, while a `deps` entry naming it does not follow. Pin any todo that
// something else depends on: `#todo("fetch")[..]`.
//
// Typst gives package code no way to emit a build warning — there is no
// `warn()`, only `panic`, and a panic here would be far too strong for what is
// a smell rather than an error. So the check lives in `#todos-validate()`
// (`graph.typ`) instead, where it can be reported alongside the cycle check
// without failing a build that has not actually broken.

// `done:` folded into the `timeline:` dictionary, so the log stays the one store
// and `#todo`'s two ways of writing a close have one destination.
//
// A TOP-LEVEL HELPER rather than a few lines inside `todo`, and that is forced:
// `todo`'s public signature has a parameter named `type`, which shadows Typst's
// built-in `type()` for the whole function body — so the assertions below cannot
// live there. (`tags.typ`'s `todo-tags` renames to `kind` for the same reason.)
