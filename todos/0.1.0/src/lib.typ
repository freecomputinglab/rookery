// @rookery/todos — todos, epics and a dependency DAG over rookery notes.
//
// A todo is an `@rookery/core` note carrying a `todo` tag, plus whatever else
// this package folds into its tag dictionary. Nothing new is stored anywhere:
// the registry rookery already keeps IS the todo database, and every view here
// is derived from it at build time.
//
// THE FRAMING THAT DECIDES WHAT IS HERE: `br` (the beads issue tracker) is a
// mutable SQLite database; this is a static build. So this package ports br's
// DERIVED VIEWS — ready, blocked, stale, graph, stats — and not its mutation
// surface. A status change here is an edit to a `.typ` file, which is the
// point rather than a shortcoming.
//
// THE ORDER OF THESE IMPORTS IS DEPENDENCY ORDER and it is load-bearing: a
// Typst `#let` closure captures the scope visible AT DEFINITION time, so a
// module can only use names from a module imported before it. A wrong order is
// an unknown-variable error, which is how this order was arrived at.

#import "target.typ": *
#import "tags.typ": *
#import "todo.typ": *
#import "graph.typ": *
#import "views.typ": *
#import "search.typ": *
// AFTER `graph.typ`, whose `is-ready`/`is-blocked` it projects, and after
// `search.typ`, where the reasoning about this package's relationship to
// @rookery/search lives. `#filter-panel` is the ONE name here sourced from that
// package — see `panel.typ`'s own header for why the edge now exists.
#import "panel.typ": *

// AFTER `graph.typ`, whose `layer-of`/`is-ready`/`is-blocked` it projects, and
// placed beside `panel.typ` above: the two are this package's only imports of
// another package's names, and it is the same reasoning both times — see
// `deck.typ`'s own header for the @rookery/slipshow edge.
#import "deck.typ": *

// LAST, and the order is as load-bearing here as it is above. `skin.typ`
// star-imports @rookery/timeline and shadows `window`; importing it last means
// that shadowed `window` is what this module exports, where importing it earlier
// would let a later star-import put rookery's own back. See its header for the
// pattern and for the one case it cannot filter.
