// `#filter-panel` — @rookery/search's panel, told about the todo graph.
//
// THE SKIN PATTERN, APPLIED SIDEWAYS. `skin.typ` re-exports @rookery/core's own
// surface with `window` overridden; this re-exports @rookery/search's
// `#filter-panel` with a version that knows what `ready` and `blocked` mean. Same
// rule as every other skin here: a site star-importing both packages gets THIS one
// as long as it imports rookery-todos LAST.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE EDGE TO @rookery/search, and it is new. `search.typ` used to
// say this package must never grow one. That rule is still right about
// `#todos-search`, which renders its own pill row and needs no panel — and it was
// wrong as a rule about the whole package. `ready` and `blocked` are derived HERE and
// nowhere else (`graph.typ`), so a panel that cannot press them is the one thing every
// consuming site ends up hand-rolling. The banner in `search.typ` now says which half
// still holds.
//
// IT DELEGATES TO `#panel`, NOT TO `#filter-panel`, and that is what buys the pill
// GROUPS. rookery-search's `#filter-panel` has one pill row and one `pill-match` for
// all of it, so `epic-jobs` + `todo-p0` UNION under the default "any" — press two,
// get more — and return nothing at all under "all", two epics being mutually
// exclusive. `#panel`'s facet mode already composes the way a reader expects
// (`panel.js`: "Within a facet the values OR .. and across facets they AND"), so
// state, epic and priority each become their own group for free.
//
// THE NAME IS THE POINT. A call site keeps writing `#filter-panel(..)`; what changes
// is that its pills are grouped and three of them are derived rather than authored.

#import "@rookery/timeline:0.1.0": deadline-of, scheduled-of
// AND AS A MODULE, for `countdown`/`days-until`: the parameter below is also called
// `countdown`, and a parameter and a function of the same name cannot both be
// reachable by that name inside the panel. Same reason `#upcoming` imports its own
// `when.typ` twice.

// SHORT AND NUMERIC, matching @rookery/search's own `_fmt-day` and
// @rookery/timeline's exactly — `27.8.26`, unpadded — so a site running two of
// these lists on one page does not show two spellings of the same kind of date.
#let _fmt-day(d) = d.display("[day padding:none].[month padding:none].[year repr:last_two]")

// The ISO form for the `datetime` attribute — zero-padded, machine-facing, and
// deliberately not what the cell shows.
#let _iso(d) = d.display("[year]-[month]-[day]")

// THE STATE FACET — where the declared status and the derived one meet.
//
// `status-of` (tags.typ) deliberately never answers "blocked": that is a question
// about the graph, and it says so. `is-ready`/`is-blocked` (graph.typ) never answer
// "in-progress": that is a declared fact, and no graph can derive it. One pill group
// needs one answer, so this is the order they resolve in.
//
// `in-progress` OUTRANKS `ready`, and that is the whole reason it is here rather than
// folded into `ready`: org-mode's STRT names the same distinction, and "someone is
// already on it" is the more useful thing to read off a list of what to pick up.
//
// The last rung is `scheduled` rather than `deferred`: it names the MECHANISM — a
// `scheduled` stage dated after `today` — and leaves `deferred` to mean what
// `status-of` already makes it mean, a todo declared as put off.
// THE FACETS THIS PACKAGE DERIVES, as against the ones a site authors. The split is
// what `state-label` lays out on two lines; naming it here keeps the two places that
// care — the projection below and the row split — reading off one list.

  when: none,
  // `"soonest"` (the default here, where rookery-search defaults to `"newest"`) puts
  // the earliest date first, because a deadline already behind you is the most urgent

  //
  // ON BY DEFAULT here, where `#upcoming`'s flag is off: a panel of OUTSTANDING WORK
  // is read for what is due next, which is the question the band answers. A row
