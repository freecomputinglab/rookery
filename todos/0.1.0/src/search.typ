// `#todos-search` — a filter box over the todos, with the matches listed below
// it as links to each todo's minted page.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT `@rookery/search`. That package already offers a fuzzy,
// todos-only bar: `#search-bar(tags: "todo")`. Two things it cannot do, and
// cannot be taught to do, are what this widget is for:
//
//   1. `ready` and `blocked` pills. Both are DERIVED from the dependency graph
//      and the calendar at build time (`graph.typ`), deliberately never stored
//      as tags — so no tag query, including rookery-search's, can select them.
//      That is the load-bearing difference.
//   2. An in-page list rather than a popup. rookery-search's surfaces are a
//      combobox with a listbox and a modal overlay; this is a filter over a
//      list already on the page. The todos stay visible and typing narrows them
//      where they sit.
//
// THIS WIDGET therefore reaches for nothing in `@rookery/search`: it renders
// its own bar, its own pills and its own list, and a project wanting only
// `#todos-search` needs nothing but this package and `@rookery/core`.
//
// WITH ONE QUALIFICATION, and it is deliberately NOT the package edge
// `panel.typ` has. There is still no import here, no manifest entry and no
// Typst dependency: with `@rookery/search` absent this widget renders and
// filters exactly as it always did. What it does now is offer ONE MORE
// capability when that package happens to be on the page — the browser half
// feature-detects the `RookerySearch` GLOBAL at wire time and, finding it,
// lets the input take a `tags:` expression against the whole tag set each row
// carries in `data-todo-tags`. Absent, the input is the plain fuzzy filter and
// nothing is raised. A runtime global rather than an import is what keeps that
// property: an import would make the dependency unconditional, which is the one
// thing this file must not do.
//
// THAT USED TO BE WRITTEN AS A RULE ABOUT THE WHOLE PACKAGE — "MUST NOT depend on
// @rookery/search" — and it was too strong. `panel.typ` now skins that
// package's `#filter-panel`, for the reason point 1 above states: `ready` and
// `blocked` are derived HERE and nowhere else, so a panel that cannot press them is
// the one thing every consuming site ends up hand-rolling. The two facts sit side by
// side — this file needs no panel, and the panel needs this file's graph.
//
// LINKS, NOT TRANSCLUSIONS. Every match is the same link row the other views
// emit. (`windows: true` on those views is a separate feature and this widget
// does not use it.)
//
// NO JSON ISLAND. Every fact the filter needs rides as a `data-` attribute on
// the row carrying it, so the payload and the markup cannot disagree — and with
// no JavaScript the rendering is the full readable list rather than an empty
// container waiting to be filled.

//
// A SEPARATE HELPER rather than a parameter on `_row`: this is the only caller
// that wants data attributes, and widening `_row` would put them on every view.
//
// NO ID IN THE MARKUP. A hardcoded id cannot appear twice on a page, and
// nothing stops a project putting two of these widgets on one. rookery-search
// documents the same rule and assigns ids at runtime; the JS here wires
// `aria-controls` from the input to the list element it already holds.
