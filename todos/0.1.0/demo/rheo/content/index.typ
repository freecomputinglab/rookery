= `@rookery/todos`

Every todo below is an ordinary `@rookery/core` note. Nothing is stored
anywhere else — the registry rookery already keeps IS the todo database, and
every view on this page is derived from it at build time.

== The todos

A closed todo, carrying the date it closed. `done:` is the shorthand for exactly
one log entry — `timeline: (closed: ..)` writes the same thing, and the two
cannot disagree because the first folds into the second.

#todo(
  "fetch",
  title: [Fetch the source],
  priority: 0,
  type: "task",
  done: datetime(year: 2026, month: 8, day: 1),
)[Pull the upstream tarball and verify its checksum.]

A todo with every attribute this package maps, including a metadata bag for
the things that need no filtering surface of their own.

#todo(
  "parse",
  title: [Parse the manifest],
  priority: 1,
  type: "bug",
  deps: ("fetch",),
  metadata: (estimate: 45, assignee: "lox", external-ref: "GH-412"),
  tags: ("phd",),
)[
  The manifest parser drops a trailing comma. Depends on #raw("fetch"), which is
  closed, so this one is ready.
]

Two todos that both depend on #raw("parse") — the branch in the graph below.

#todo("render", title: [Render output], deps: ("parse",), tags: ("frontend",))[
  Blocked until the parser lands.
]
#todo("style", title: [Style output], deps: ("parse",), type: "chore", tags: ("frontend",))[
  Also blocked.
]

A todo depending on both branches, and one depending on that in turn: three
levels deep.

#todo(
  "ship",
  title: [Ship it],
  priority: 1,
  deps: ("render", "style"),
  tags: ("frontend", "phd"),
)[The release itself.]
#todo("docs", title: [Write the docs], type: "docs", deps: ("ship",))[Follows the release.]

A DEFERRED todo. Its `scheduled` date comes from `@rookery/timeline`, merged
through `tags:` — this package takes no date parameters of its own, because
dates are one concept owned by one package.

#todo(
  "retro",
  title: [Run the retro],
  priority: 2,
  tags: entries(scheduled: datetime(year: 2026, month: 12, day: 1)),
)[Not ready until December, even though nothing blocks it.]

A todo with a DEADLINE, from the same package.

#todo(
  "audit",
  title: [Security audit],
  priority: 0,
  tags: entries(deadline: datetime(year: 2026, month: 9, day: 15)),
)[Ready now, and due next month.]

A STALE todo: open, and untouched since January.

#todo(
  "cleanup",
  title: [Clean up the fixtures],
  type: "chore",
  updated: datetime(year: 2026, month: 1, day: 1),
)[Nobody has looked at this in months.]

A todo whose dependency does not exist. A dangling dep is deliberately NOT an
error — it is reported by `#todos-validate()` and drawn dashed in the graph.

#todo("blog", title: [Write the blog post], deps: ("nope",))[Depends on a note that isn't here.]

== A closed todo is not transcluded

`#window` from this package renders nothing for a closed todo — the thing is done,
and the reason to window one is to have it in front of you. Between these two
paragraphs there is a `#window("fetch")`, and `fetch` is closed:

#window("fetch")

...and `closed: true` opts it back in, for a page that is deliberately a record:

#window("fetch", closed: true)

An OPEN todo is unaffected, which is the control:

#window("parse")

== An epic

`#epic(name)` returns a `#todo` variant with a shared tag bound. Membership is
one more tag and nothing else: an epic creates no parent/child edge and implies
no dependency, so these two are unrelated until one names the other.

#let launch = epic("launch")
#launch("launch-plan", title: [Draft the launch plan], priority: 1)[Kick-off.]
#launch("launch-post", title: [Announce the launch], deps: ("launch-plan",))[Follows the plan.]

== A close as a factory

`#done(date)` is the other shorthand and the same fold: a `#todo` variant with
`done:` bound, so it keeps every other argument. It is a factory rather than a
function taking the date first because `#todo`'s first positional is the note's
ID, and a date there would take that slot.

#let closed-in-july = done(datetime(year: 2026, month: 7, day: 20))
#closed-in-july("spike", title: [Spike the parser], type: "task")[Threw it away, as intended.]
#closed-in-july("triage", title: [Triage the backlog], priority: 3, tags: ("phd",))[
  Same date, said once — which is the case this form is for.
]

== Ready — `br ready`

Open, unblocked, and not deferred past today. The deferral clause is what makes
this `br`'s ready and not merely "not blocked".

#todos-ready(today: TODAY)

The same rows again with `windows: true`, each an unfoldable transclusion of
the todo's own body rather than a link to its minted page. Paged and EPUB
targets fall back to the link list above, since there is no fold to click.

#todos-ready(today: TODAY, windows: true)

== Blocked — `br blocked`

Each row names what blocks it. A list of blocked things without their blockers
tells you nothing you could act on.

#todos-blocked()

== Stale — `br stale`

Open and untouched for over 30 days. `updated` is rookery core's own field, not
a tag of ours.

#todos-stale(today: TODAY, older-than: 30)

== Stats — `br stats`

#todos-stats(today: TODAY)

== Everything open — `br list`

#todos-list(closed: false)

== Filter them

Type to narrow the list; the pills refine it further. `ready` and `blocked` are
derived from the graph and stamped in at build time, which is why no tag query
could offer them. With JavaScript off the input and pills are hidden and this is
simply a list.

#todos-search(today: TODAY)

== Filter them in groups — `#filter-panel`

The other filter, and the difference is the pills. `#todos-search` above renders
one undifferentiated row of them; this is `@rookery/search`'s `#panel` told about
the todo graph, so the pills come in GROUPS — epic and tag on the first line,
state and priority on the second — and they compose the way a reader expects: the
values within a group OR, and the groups AND. Press `blocked` and `p1` and you get
blocked todos of priority one, not both lists concatenated.

NOTHING BELOW DECLARES A TAG. The `tag` group is every plain tag the listed todos
actually carry, so `frontend` and `phd` have pills because two todos were written
with them — and `launch` does not appear twice despite being both an epic and a
bare tag on its two todos. Add a tag to a todo above and its pill is there on the
next build.

#filter-panel(today: TODAY, visible: 6, noun: "open todos")

== The dependency graph

Rendered client-side from a JSON payload. With JavaScript off it degrades to
the linked list the payload sits beside, so the dependencies stay readable.

#todo-graph-view(today: TODAY)

The same graph with `closed: false` — the open todos only, and no edge pointing
at a box that is no longer drawn. Status is still computed against the WHOLE
graph, so `parse` still reads as ready: its one dependency is the closed
`fetch`, which is done rather than merely hidden.

#todo-graph-view(today: TODAY, closed: false)

#todos-validate()
