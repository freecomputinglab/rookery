// Shared setup for this demo, applied by every vertebra.
//
// `today` lives here as ONE literal because nothing in this stack may call
// `datetime.today()`: it returns 1980-01-01 under a reproducible build and does
// not error while doing it, so every view that needs a "now" takes it as an
// argument. Bump this line to age the demo.
