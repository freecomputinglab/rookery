// Compresses the rookery's corpus ONCE per build, at the bundle root.
//
// rheo inlines this file verbatim at the bundle root when a project imports
// `@rookery/search`, so it runs once for the whole build with the finished
// note registry in scope — the same place `@rookery/core`'s own `.marrow.typ`
// mints note pages from. Everything it publishes is read back through
// `_corpus-cache` by `#search-index`, which runs once per emitted page; see that
// state's comment in `src/lib.typ` for the measurements that make this worth
// having (~118ms per page against ~15ms for the island's own JSON, on a
// 200-note corpus).
//
// WITHOUT RHEO there is no bundle root, this file never runs, the state keeps
// its `(:)` default and `#search-index` compresses inline as it always did.
// Nothing here is required for correctness — it is a cache, and a miss is only
// slower, never different.
