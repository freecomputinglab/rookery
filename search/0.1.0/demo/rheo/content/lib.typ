// The one place the package is configured, applied by both vertebrae.

// `#show: rookery` is per-FILE — an import cannot install it for another file —

// The template rookery hands to `.marrow.typ` for each minted note page.
//
// A NAMED TOP-LEVEL FUNCTION, deliberately: the package stores this on a
// document-wide state and `.final()` reads it, so an inline closure built inside
// `demo` below would be a different value per vertebra and whichever file
// happened to be last would win (lib.typ's own warning above
// `_idea-page-template`). The banner is what proves in the output that this
// template ran at all.
// `id` is `none` on ONE minted page: the `ideas/index.html` landing page, which
// is the rookery rather than any one note (and gets `note: (:)` for the same
// reason). A template that assumes a string here fails the build the moment a
// project sets `index-page: true`, so this one branches — which is the shape a
// real project's template wants too.
