// @rookery/search — fuzzy search over a rookery.
//
// Reads the corpus through `@rookery/core`'s public primitives and never
// touches its internals: `ideas()` for the notes, `note-href()` for links.
// Nothing here RENDERS a note's body — the modal's preview pane fetches the
// note's own minted page at runtime instead (see `search-modal` below), so
// this package's build cost is one pass over the registry per page rather
// than one full body render per note per page.
//
// Two layers, and the split matters:
//   - `search-ideas(query)` is pure Typst and works under plain
//     `typst compile` — build a static list of matches with no JavaScript.
//   - `search-index()` and `search-bar()` are RHEO ONLY. The bar's script is
//     injected by rheo from this manifest's `js_scripts`, and the index links
//     to minted note pages, which only rheo produces.
//
// BUILT, unlike `@rookery/core`: `typst.toml` points at `dist/`, and `dist/`
// comes from `just build` (vite copies this file and the CSS across and
// bundles `src/search.js` into `dist/lib.js`). Editing `src/` does
// NOT take effect until you rebuild — the one ergonomic cost of shipping JS.
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": ideas, note-href

// THE ENTRYPOINT IS A MANIFEST. Every name this package exports lives in one of
// the modules below, and `#import "x.typ": *` re-exports transitively — so
// `@rookery/search:0.1.0` stays a single import for a project and
// `.marrow.typ` keeps resolving `_compress-corpus`, `_corpus-cache` and
// `_corpus-key` by name.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE DEPENDENCY ORDER and it is load-bearing: a `#let` closure
// captures the scope visible AT DEFINITION time, and Typst has no cycles to fall
// back on. `ideas.typ` sits above `corpus.typ` because `#search-index` calls
// `#search-ideas`; with the two the other way round the package built, both test
// suites passed, and a real site failed with `unknown variable: search-ideas` —
// which is why `rheo compile` on rookery.ohrg.org is part of this package's
// checks and not only `just test`.
#import "base.typ": *
#import "tagquery.typ": *
// AFTER `tagquery.typ` AND BEFORE `rank.typ`, which is the dependency order the
// paragraph above demands rather than tidy alphabetical accident: `rank.typ`'s
// `_rank` calls `fuzzy-score` and `body-score`, which now live here. Put this line
// below `rank.typ` and the package still builds while a real site fails with
// `unknown variable: fuzzy-score` — the exact failure that paragraph records.
#import "score.typ": *
#import "rank.typ": *
#import "lookup.typ": *
// BEFORE `corpus.typ`, whose `#search-index` calls `_compress-corpus` — the same
// dependency-order rule this manifest states throughout. `.marrow.typ` resolves
// `_compress-corpus` through this entrypoint, so the name has to arrive here too.
#import "compress.typ": *
#import "corpus.typ": *
#import "ui.typ": *
#import "panel.typ": *
// AFTER `panel.typ`, and the order matters for the reason this manifest states: a
// closure captures its definition scope. `#filter-panel` is panel's sibling — same
// chrome, a tag scope and authored pills instead of projected facets — and it reaches
// `#idea-row` from @rookery/core, which the top of this file already imports from.
#import "filter-panel.typ": *
