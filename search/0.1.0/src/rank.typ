// The ranking rule: fuzzy scoring, body scoring, and the two tiers.
//
// `_rank` takes the rows it ranks rather than reading them, which is what lets
// `test/parity.typ` hand it the same fixtures the JavaScript gets. Every number
// here has a twin in src/search.js; change one and change the other, or
// `just parity` will say so.

#import "base.typ": *
// BOTH HALVES OF A QUERY, from the two modules that own them: `tagquery.typ` for
// `split-query`/`eval-tag-query`, `score.typ` for `fuzzy-score`/`body-score`. That
// is the whole of what `_rank` does — extract the tag expression, filter by it,
// rank the residual — and it is the one file that needs both.
//
// TWO IMPORTS RATHER THAN ONE, since the scorer moved out of `tagquery.typ`. This
// file was the only Typst caller of it, and MEASURED: without this line `just
// parity` fails with `unknown variable: fuzzy-score` at `rank.typ:91`. The
// manifest order in `lib.typ` does not cover it — a module resolves its own
// imports, not the manifest's.

// ---- _rank — the tiering rule, over rows GIVEN rather than read ------------
//
// Split out of `#search-ideas` so `test/parity.typ` can run the rule on a
// literal corpus. The rule is implemented TWICE by design — here, and as
// `search` in `src/search.js` — and until this was a pure function of
// its rows, only the two LEAF scorers could be diffed: the layer that decides
// tiers, order and `limit` was duplicated and unchecked. `#search-ideas` below
// is now this, plus its asserts, plus `ideas()`.
//
// ROWS MUST ARRIVE IN ID ORDER, which is exactly what `ideas()` guarantees
// ("ordered by id so a build is reproducible"). Ties within a tier fall to
// Typst's stable sort, i.e. to the incoming order, where the JavaScript side
// breaks them by id explicitly. The two agree for id-ordered input and can
// disagree for anything else, so an arbitrarily ordered corpus is outside the
// parity guarantee — which is why the fixture keeps its rows id-ordered, and why
// this comment is here rather than a defensive sort nobody needs.
//
// THE `tags:` SPLIT LIVES HERE, not in `#search-ideas`, because `search` in
// `src/search.js` is this function's counterpart and splits in exactly
// the same place. Keeping the split inside the rule means the fixture can diff a
// TAG QUERY across the two languages as data, the same way it diffs a text one,
// and `_rank`'s signature stays `(rows, query, ...)` — passing a pre-parsed RPN
// down from `#search-ideas` would have widened it and left the parse untested.
//
// Private: the public surface is `#search-ideas`. `test/parity.typ` imports it
// by relative path, the same way it imports `fuzzy-score`.
#let _rank(rows, query, limit: none, body-search: true) = {
  // SPLIT ONCE, before the loop. A parse is cheap (about 60 microseconds,
  // MEASURED at `parse-tag-query`) but its answer cannot change between rows, so
  // parsing per row would buy nothing and cost a parse per note.
  //
  // `q` IS THE RESIDUAL TEXT, and every scorer below sees it rather than `query`
  // — otherwise a `tags:draft window` query would hand the literal "tags:draft"
  // to `fuzzy-score` and match nothing.
  //
  // THE EMPTY RESIDUAL IS NO LONGER "NO SPECIAL CASE": `fuzzy-score` still
  // returns 0 for an empty query, so every surviving note ties at score 0 in the
  // NAME tier — but a plain stable sort over that tie is no longer the wanted
  // answer. For `q == ""` (a bare `""` query, or a `tags:`-only query with no
  // residual) the DEFAULT/BROWSE listing sorts dated notes newest-first, with
  // undated notes falling to the end in their old id order. This mirrors
  // `_sort-ids` in rookery's own `src/pure.typ` (`sort: "date"`) — same
  // dated/undated split, same zero-padded `[year][month][day]` stamp comparison,
  // same dedup-and-walk-descending — over the SAME field, `e.created`.
  //
  // IT READ `e.updated` UNTIL 0.6.0, and that field no longer exists: rookery
  // removed it, leaving a note's lifecycle to @rookery/timeline' log. Left
  // alone, this branch would have found `none` on every row, dropped every note
  // into the undated bucket, and silently reverted the browse listing to id
  // order — no error, just the wrong answer, which is why this is filed as a bug
  // rather than a follow-up. The body tier stays empty for `q == ""` either way,
  // `body-score` returning `none` for an empty query.

    // `tags:` query spends its slots on notes the filter rejects. MEASURED in the
    // JavaScript port over a synthetic corpus with 1200-cluster bodies, it is a
    // large speedup too, because the pool the body tier walks shrinks before it is
    // walked — at 5000 notes, 15.1 ms for a bare "window depth" against 0.850 ms
    // for "tags:note&draft". A negation (`tags:!draft`) keeps most of the corpus
    // and so costs the baseline: expected, not a regression.
    //
    // A TAG MATCH IS A PREDICATE, NOT A SCORER, so `continue` is the only thing it
    // may do here. It adds no third tier and no bonus to `score`, and the tiering
    // below is therefore untouched by it: tags decide WHICH notes are candidates,
    // never how they rank.

    // `tags` field must read as untagged rather than error. Under `ideas()` the
