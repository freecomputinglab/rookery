// ---- The corpus pass — a note compressed to its most distinctive terms -----
//
// What `#search-index` puts in a row's `body`. NOT a prose prefix: that field is
// MATCH-ONLY now (the modal's preview pane fetches the note's own minted page
// rather than excerpting the island — see `#search-modal`), so its bytes are
// spent on the terms that DISTINGUISH a note instead of on whatever the note
// happened to open with.
//
// MEASURED on weeknotes.ohrg.org (56 notes): the old 1200-cluster prefix cap
// shipped 48,587 of 76,420 body chars, so 36% of the corpus prose was not
// findable in the browser AT ALL. At `body-terms: 48` and `df-ceiling: 40` the
// terms cost 18,791B and the whole island ~24,190B, against 54,610B before — 44%
// of the old cost, with whole-note coverage. 38 of the 56 notes hit the 48-term
// cap, so the budget is real and not slack.
//
// NO WEIGHTS ARE SHIPPED. Position is the weight, and `body-score` reads rank.
// MEASURED and this is why: in notes this short almost every term has tf=1, so
// the weight collapses to idf, and idf is a property of the TERM (identical
// across notes), so a digit-per-term weight string cost 11% overhead to
// distinguish only the top two or three terms. Rank carries what is left.
//
// BUILD TIME ONLY, and it stays that way: none of this is ported to JavaScript
// and none of it should be, because the browser matches against the RESULT.
// `body-score`/`bodyScore` are the only pair that needs porting.

// The stopword FLOOR — not the filter. MEASURED: the island is 15,112B with this
// list and 15,047B without it, a 0.4% difference, because the df ceiling below
// already catches nearly everything on it. It is here for a SMALL rookery, where
// too few notes exist for df to carry any signal at all.
//
// Function words only, and nothing shorter than three clusters: `_tokenize`'s
// length floor has already dropped `a`, `is`, `of`, `to`, `it` and the rest
// before this dictionary is consulted, so listing them would be dead weight.
// That is also why `im` and `id` are absent while `ive`/`wasnt`/`dont` are here —
// the contractions appear in their apostrophe-stripped form, since an apostrophe
// never survives tokenization.
//
// TYPOS ARE NOT FILTERED, deliberately: `somethign` is in the note, and a reader
// who typed the same typo should find it.
//
// A DICTIONARY, not an array, for the same reason as `_prec`: the question asked
// of every token is a key test, and `t in _stopwords` is that test, where array
// membership is a scan of a hundred strings per token.
#let _stopwords = {
  // Parenthesised, and it has to be: in Typst CODE mode a line break ends the
  // statement, so a continuation line opening with `+` is read as a unary plus

// are kept INSIDE a token. MEASURED against this corpus: `0.5.1`,
// `rheo-context`, `eco-marxist` and `marrow.typ` are exactly what a reader
// searches for, and splitting them yields `5`, `1`, `rheo`, `context` — none of
// which is the thing wanted. A LEADING `.` is kept too, so `.marrow.typ` survives
// verbatim; the dotted form then answers both queries, a dotless one still being
// a substring of it, where the stripped form answers only the dotless query. A
// TRAILING `.`/`-` is stripped, that one being sentence punctuation rather than
// part of the term (`code.` -> `code`, `well-` -> `well`). The cost of one rule
// doing both is that `word.Next` with no space after the stop reads as a single
// term; a plain-text body puts a space there.
//
// `_` IS A SPLITTER, not a token character. `.` and `-` are the two exceptions
// and the set is closed — every addition is another character a reader has to
// type exactly to match what the build kept.
//
// Dropped: tokens under 3 clusters, bare digit runs, and the stopword floor. A
// bare digit run is `^[0-9]+$` and nothing looser, so `0.5.1` and an id like
// `26w30` are NOT bare numbers and survive — they are among the most distinctive
// terms a note has.

// a matter of taste. `#search-index` runs on EVERY output page, so this pass is
// called once per page. MEASURED (typst 0.15.1, 2026-08-17) with a pure function

// 6242 ms, about 21x. Typst memoises a pure call keyed on its ARGUMENTS, so this
// pass costs once per build as long as every argument is page-invariant.
//

// ---- The build-once corpus cache ------------------------------------------
//
// `_compress-corpus` is a pure function of its arguments and Typst memoises it
// perfectly WITHIN one document — MEASURED natively: 20 identical calls cost
// the same 1.1s as one, whether the argument array is a reused value or rebuilt
// with `.map` on every call, inside `context` or not. None of the obvious
// suspects defeats it.
//
// Under rheo it does not collapse, and that is what this cache is for. rheo
// emits many documents from one build, and the memo does not carry across them.
// MEASURED on a synthetic rookery of 200 notes at 1500 words, 40 vertebrae, one
// `#search-modal` each:
//
//     40 vertebrae emitting the island   10.2s
//      1 vertebra  emitting the island    5.6s
//     40 vertebrae, body-search: false     1.0s
//
// so ~118ms per emitting page, against ~15ms for the island's own JSON, which
// scales the whole build by the page count on exactly the sites big enough to
// want search.
//
// `.marrow.typ` next to this file runs ONCE at the bundle root, compresses the
// whole rookery there, and publishes the result here. KEYED BY NOTE ID, not by
// position: `#search-index` selects and orders its own rows, and an id lookup
// survives both. The knobs that change the terms are in the key too, so an index
// built with different `body-terms`/`df-ceiling` never reads another's terms.
//
// EMPTY WITHOUT RHEO, which is the whole fallback: `.final()` gives `(:)`, every
// lookup misses, and `#search-index` compresses inline exactly as before. Same
// under rheo for a TAG-FILTERED index — see the miss path at its call site.

//   #search-index(tags: "phd")             // only the notes tagged phd
//
// Emits `<script type="application/json" id="rookery-search-index">[...]</script>`,
// one row per note: `(id, name, text, tags, body, created, href)`, where `text`
// is the plain-text title ("" when untitled), `tags` is the note's own tag
// array (THE KEY IS ABSENT when it has none), `body` is that note's compressed
// term string ("" when it compresses to nothing), `created` is that note's
// resolved date as a zero-padded `"[year][month][day]"` string (THE KEY IS
// ABSENT when the note is undated — never shipped as `""` or `null`; this is
// the same stamp `_rank` computes from `e.created` for the default/browse
// listing, see its comment), and `href` is the depth-relative
// path to the note's minted page — computed against the page this call sits on,
// so an island in a site's shared chrome comes out right on a nested vertebra
// too.
//
// The field is `text`, not `title`, on purpose: same name, same meaning, same
// type as `search-ideas` returns. `title` there is CONTENT, which JSON cannot
// carry, and one name meaning two types across two surfaces is how a consumer
// gets it wrong.
//
// `body-terms` AND `df-ceiling` CONTROL THE COMPRESSION, and there is no
// character cap any more: a row's `body` is `_compress-corpus`' output for that
// note — its `body-terms` most distinctive terms, space-joined in weight order,
// with every term appearing in more than `df-ceiling` percent of the SELECTED
// notes dropped first. The measurements behind both defaults are recorded at
// `_compress-corpus`.
//
// `body-chars` IS RETIRED, and that is 0.3.0's breaking change. The budget is a
// term count now, because a prefix cap spent the bytes on whatever a note
// happened to open with and hid the rest of it from the browser entirely —
// MEASURED, 36% of weeknotes' prose was unfindable in the bar. It is legal only
// because this field is no longer read as prose: the preview pane fetches the
// note's own page instead of excerpting the island.
//
// A cap of SOME kind is not optional, because the island is INLINE IN EVERY
// PAGE, not fetched once: MEASURED for rookery.ohrg.org, its `content/*.typ`
// sources total ~31 KB across roughly 40 notes, so an uncapped index costs on
// the order of 20-25 KB of JSON on every page.
//
// THE FIELD IS STILL CALLED `body` and still holds plain text — what changed is
// its CONTENT, not its name or its type. `search()` in
// `src/search.js` reads `hit.body` and `snippet` excerpts it for the
// failed-fetch fallback; both keep working, and the string they get simply reads
// as a keyword row rather than as a note's opening sentence.
//
// `df-ceiling` IS MEASURED OVER THE SELECTED NOTES, so `tags:` below moves it: a
// term common across a whole rookery can be distinctive within one tag's notes,
// and each island's ceiling is computed for the corpus it actually carries.
//
// A NOTE CAN COMPRESS TO NOTHING, and its `body` is then `""`. MEASURED, one note
// on weeknotes did, its body being genuinely empty. Such a note is unfindable by
// body — the same as an empty note already was — and its keyword row is empty.
//
// `body-search: false` OMITS THE `body` FIELD ALTOGETHER — a row is then
// `(id, name, text, href)`, and the island shrinks to roughly the sum of the
// corpus's ids and titles. It is the same switch `#search-ideas` takes and
// means the same thing on both sides of the language boundary: the browser
// searches ids and titles only. No JavaScript change is needed to enforce it,
// and that is by construction rather than luck — `search()` in
// `src/search.js` reads `row.body ?? ""`, and `bodyScore("", q)` is
// `null` for every non-empty query, so a row with no body simply cannot produce
// a body-tier hit. Leaving the field out is therefore the whole implementation.
//
// Two consequences worth stating plainly. A note findable ONLY by a word in its
// body becomes unfindable — that is the point, not a regression. And the modal's
// preview pane loses the keyword row drawn from this field, so on `file://`
// (where the rich preview cannot be fetched) it shows "No preview"; over http the
// fetched page is unaffected.
//
// EITHER WAY THE TYPST SIDE STAYS EXHAUSTIVE: `#search-ideas` scores full bodies
// and never truncated, so a term this island drops — to `body-search: false`, to
// the `df-ceiling`, or to the `body-terms` cut — is still findable there. See its
// comment on that deliberate asymmetry.
//
// WHY NOT A SEPARATE FETCHED JSON FILE, which would keep pages small: rheo
// emits pages from typst, and there is no supported way for a package to emit
// a standalone asset file next to them. An inline island is what the package
// can actually produce, and it also works from `file://` with no fetch.
//
// `search-bar` emits this itself, so most projects never call it. Call it
// directly when building a custom UI, or when several bars share one index —
// see `search-bar`'s `index:` parameter.
//
// The rows are `search-ideas("")` — the empty query matching everything — with
// the fields JSON cannot carry dropped, and unmintable notes filtered out. No
// `body-search:` is forwarded to that call and none is wanted: an empty query
// returns `none` from `body-score` for every note, so the body tier is empty
// whatever the switch says, and every row arrives through the name tier.
//
// `tags:`/`match:` ARE forwarded there, and they scope the island: a note the
// selection excludes is not in the JSON, so the browser cannot find it. That is
// how a bar over just the notes tagged `phd` is built — see `#search-bar`.
//
// EACH ROW CARRIES ITS NOTE'S `tags`, because the browser now has something left
// to decide with them: a reader types `tags:(a|b)&c` into the bar and the script
// evaluates that expression per row (see `#search-ideas`' comment on the two
// axes). The author's `tags:` parameter below still settles the CORPUS in Typst —
// what ships is the field the reader's own filter reads.
//
// MEASURED, 40 notes with tags present, bodies under 0.2.0's 1200-cluster prefix
// cap: 51.1 KB -> 51.8 KB, so +723 B, +1.4%, about 18 B per note. The per-note
// cost is unchanged now that the cap is a term budget; the PERCENTAGE is larger,
// the rest of the row having shrunk.
//
// THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `tag-search: false` SWITCH. 18 B a note does not earn a
// knob — `body-search: false` earns one because it removes the largest field in
// the row, and a per-project judgement about whether full-text hits are noise has
// no counterpart here.
//
// THE KEY IS OMITTED for an untagged note rather than written as `()`, exactly as
// `body-search: false` omits `body`: an absent key means "none", where `()` would
// cost a key per row to say the same thing. The port reads `row.tags ?? []`.

// MEASURED before this existed: 34 of `#search-bar`'s 66 code lines were byte
// for byte the same as lines in `#search-modal` — the parameter list, the
// guard, four asserts and the whole `#search-index` call with its six forwarded
// arguments. Bead `rp-modal-limit-default-c88` was that duplication biting: the
// modal's JavaScript fallback for `limit` had drifted from the Typst default.
//
// `where` is the caller's name for the messages, the same convention the
// `_assert-*` validators above use.
//
// NOT SHARED, deliberately: the `<input>` element. Both spell the same eight
// attributes, but in a different ORDER, and Typst emits them in the order given
// — so one canonical version would change the bytes of every page carrying the
// other. That is a real cleanup and it needs its own bead, with a diff a
// reviewer can look at, not a silent rider on this one.
//
// The guard `if _target() != "html" or _rheo-ctx() == none { return }` stays in
// both too: `return` belongs to the function that means to return.
