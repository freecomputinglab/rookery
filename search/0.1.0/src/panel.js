// Browser half of `#panel` in `src/panel.typ`: filter, rank and reorder the rows
// already on the page.
//
// NOTHING IS FETCHED AND NOTHING IS BUILT HERE. The Typst side emitted every row
// up front with its haystack and its faceted values as `data-` attributes, so
// this only shows, hides and reorders them. If it never runs, the page is a
// complete readable list and the stylesheet keeps the chrome that would do
// nothing out of sight.
//
// GENERIC OVER WHATEVER FIELDS A ROW CARRIES. A panel declares its facets in
// Typst; this reads the pill groups off the DOM and takes each group's
// `data-panel-group` as the attribute name to test. So no facet vocabulary lives
// here, which is what lets one implementation serve submissions, todos and
// anything else.
//
// TWO PANEL KINDS, TOLD APART BY `data-panel-mode`. `#panel` (no mode) filters on
// projected fields, ORing within a group and ANDing across groups. `#filter-panel`
// (`mode="tags"`) filters on bare tag names off `data-panel-tags`, composing them the
// way `data-panel-pill-match` says — "any" by default, "all" to intersect. One
// `wirePanel` serves both and only the predicate branches.
//
// THE SCORER IS `score` FROM `score.js`, imported rather than re-ported. That
// function had three copies across this repo and a consuming site before panels
// existed; adding a fourth here would have been the whole problem again.

// than nothing.

// THE TAG PANEL'S PREDICATE (`#filter-panel`, `data-panel-mode="tags"`), and it reads
// the panel's declared composition rather than picking one:
//
//   "any" (THE DEFAULT) — a row survives if it carries ANY pressed tag, so a second
//   pill WIDENS the result. Default because the tags a pill row is built from are
//   usually MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE in practice — one epic per todo, one sort per
//   submission — and ANDing two of those can only ever return nothing. A filter whose
//   commonest two-press outcome is an empty list is the wrong default whatever the set
//   theory says.
//
//   "all" — a row survives only if it carries EVERY pressed tag, so a second pill
//   narrows. Right where tags genuinely stack (a todo that is `urgent` AND
//   `epic-jobs`), and declared per panel.
//
// AN EMPTY SET PASSES EVERYTHING in both modes, which is what makes "no pills pressed"
// show the whole list rather than none of it — the same rule the facet path relies on.
//
// EXPORTED for the node suite, not for consumers: `src/search.js` — the
// package's public surface — does not re-export it, the same line `test/internal.mjs`
// draws for the three helpers it bridges. A predicate this small is exactly the kind
