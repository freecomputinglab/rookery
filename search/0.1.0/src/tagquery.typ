// The `tags:` query language: a boolean expression over a note's tags.
//
// A shunting-yard parse to RPN, an evaluator over that RPN, and the atom
// extractor the UI marks matched pills with. The biggest single subject in this
// package and the one with a JavaScript twin — `parseTagQuery`/`evalTagQuery` in
// src/search.js, pinned to this file case for case by test/parity.mjs.

#import "base.typ": *

// ---- tags: query — a boolean expression over a note's tags ----------------
//
//   tags:(a|b)&c        `&` binds tighter than `|`; `()` groups
//   tags:!draft         `!` negates, binds tightest, right-associative
//   tags:draft window   an unescaped SPACE ends the tag expression; the rest
//                       ("window") is the residual text query
//   tags:a\&b           `\` escapes the next cluster into the current atom
//   tags:in-progress    atoms and tags are BOTH folded, so `-`/`_`/space agree
//
// This is the READER'S axis, typed into the bar, and it is a different thing
// from `#search-ideas`' `tags:` PARAMETER, which an author fixes at build time.
// Both narrow the corpus before a single score is computed; neither makes a tag
// into a search term (see `#search-ideas`' comment).
//
// THE ESCAPE SET IS EXACTLY `( ) | & ! \` AND IS FROZEN. A tag containing one of
// those characters must be escaped in a query, and promoting some further
// character to an operator later would silently change what queries already
// written mean. Adding to this set is a breaking change, not a feature.
//
// SHUNTING-YARD RATHER THAN RECURSIVE DESCENT, for two load-bearing reasons:
// (1) an iterative parser emits an RPN token ARRAY, which `test/parity.typ` can
// diff across the two languages AS DATA, exactly as it already diffs scores;
// (2) it needs no recursion, so a deeply nested query cannot hit Typst's
// call-depth ceiling.
//
// MEASURED (typst 0.15.1): 1000 parses plus 500 evaluations cost 61 ms in
// total, about 60 microseconds per parse — against a build that does ONE parse.
// Cheap enough that nothing here is worth caching.
//
// `src/search.js` gets the same rules for the live bar, and the two must
// agree token for token; the `<tag-parity>` fixture is what pins them. Every
// decision below is mirrored there, so change neither copy alone.

// The operator table. A DICTIONARY, not an array of operators plus a lookup:
// `c in _prec` is then a KEY test — precisely the question the tokenizer asks of
// each cluster — and the precedence it needs next is in the same structure.
#let _prec = ("!": 3, "&": 2, "|": 1)

// Parse everything after `tags:` into RPN, plus the text that followed the
// expression. `(rpn: (("atom"|"op", str), ..), residual: str, repaired: (str, ..))`.
//
// A token is a 2-TUPLE, `("atom", "draft")` / `("op", "&")`, and not a
// dictionary: JSON-comparable and cheap, and the JavaScript port uses the same
// two slots so the fixture can diff them as data.
//
// PARSING NEVER FAILS. Every malformed form repairs itself and records a reason:
// `tags:(a|` -> `["a" |]` + `unclosed-open`, `tags:)a` -> `["a"]` +
// `unmatched-close`, `tags:a&` -> `["a" &]` (a dangling operator that
// `eval-tag-query` then skips for want of operands). This is not laxity: in a
// live search box every prefix of a valid query is typed on the way to it, so
// `tags:(a|` MUST behave as `tags:a` rather than as an error. One lenient rule
// shared by both languages is also the only version of this that can be
// parity-tested — two different error paths could not be diffed. `repaired` is
// returned for a future affordance in the bar and has no consumer yet.

// AND match over a note's body: `none` unless every whitespace-split term in
// `query` appears as a substring of some SPACE-SEPARATED TERM of `body`,
// otherwise an integer score, higher is better. Deliberately NOT `fuzzy-score`
// — that is a subsequence matcher, good over a 40-character id and noise over a
// body, where its length term clamps to 0 for nearly everything.
//
// `body` IS A TERM LIST wherever the browser calls this. What `#search-index`
// ships is `_compress-corpus`' output: a note's most distinctive terms,
// space-joined IN WEIGHT ORDER. `#search-ideas` calls the same function on FULL
// prose (see the asymmetry documented there), where a "term" is simply a word
// and the rule degrades to word-position earliness.
//
// AND across terms — every term must appear — is what keeps a multi-word query
// from behaving like an OR and dragging in the whole corpus. Matching is by
// SUBSTRING per term, so a prefix query still lands: `justif` finds
// `justification`, `0.5` finds `0.5.1`.
//
// THE SCORE IS RANK, because in a compressed body position IS the weight (no
// weights are shipped — see `_compress-corpus`). Per query term:
// `max(1, 10 - int(rank / 4))`, where `rank` is the index of the first kept term
// containing it, plus 3 when the query term IS a kept term exactly. Summed over
// the terms. The exact-match bonus tests membership of the whole list, not
// equality with the term at `rank`, so a prefix hit high up does not cost a note
// the bonus its exact term earns further down.
//
// MEASURED in the spike: "rheo-context" scores 13 / 12 / 11 across
// `idea:26w30-rheo`, `26w28-rheo` and `26w29-rheo` purely by where the term sits
// in each note's weight order.
//
// NO PHRASE BONUS. The +6 for the whole query appearing contiguously is gone:
// no phrase survives compression, so it could never fire.
//
// NO 200-CLUSTER BUCKETS EITHER, and with them goes the last place the two
// languages could disagree about offsets — `str.position` is a byte offset,
// JavaScript's `indexOf` a UTF-16 one, and the old rule had to re-count both
// through `.clusters()` to agree. A rank is a term INDEX, which both languages
// count identically for free.
//
// `lower`, NOT `_fold`, and the difference is load-bearing: `_fold` turns `-`
// and `_` into spaces, which would split `rheo-context` — the exact token
// `_tokenize` works to preserve — into two query terms and destroy the
// exact-match +3. Little is lost, because matching is per-term substring: the
// query "flat ids" still finds the term `flat-ids`, both halves being substrings
// of it. What IS lost is the reverse, "flat-ids" typed at a body that spells it
// as two words. That trade buys exact-term scoring and is deliberate.
//
// BOTH SIDES SPLIT ON A LITERAL SPACE, not on whitespace generally, and neither
// side may be "fixed" alone. `_compress-corpus` joins with a space, so the
// browser's input never holds anything else; a full prose body reaching here from
// `#search-ideas` can hold a newline, which then sits inside a term and only
// coarsens its rank. Typst's `split(" ")` and JavaScript's `split(" ")` treat
// that identically — a whitespace regex on one side would not.
//
// Integer arithmetic throughout, same reason as `fuzzy-score`:
// `src/search.js` ports this rule for the live bar and `just parity`
// diffs the two number for number.
