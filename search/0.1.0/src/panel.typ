// `#panel` — a filter-and-sort widget over a `tag-index` projection.
//
// WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN CORE. @rookery/core ships no JavaScript at all, and
// this repo's CLAUDE.md records that as deliberate: "search is only worth having
// with JavaScript, and rookery is the one package here that ships none", which is
// why search was split out in the first place. A panel is the same case, and this
// package already has the vite build, the fuzzy scorer and an import of rookery.
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES. One fuzzy subsequence scorer was being written three times
// across two packages and a consuming site — `src/score.js` here,
// `todo-search.js` in @rookery/todos, and a site's own hand-rolled copy
// whose comment said outright that it was "Ported from `todo-search.js`" — with
// three near-identical Typst halves above them, each existing because
// `#todos-search` renders its pill row internally with no hook to add a facet to.
// A panel closes both gaps: facets are DECLARED, and a derived value reaches a
// facet through a projection.
//
//   #let INDEX = tag-index((sort: (family: "sort-"), state: (from: ..)))
//   #panel(
//     rows: ideas(tags: "submission", index: INDEX),
//     facets: ("sort", "state"),
//     sort: "deadline",
//     visible: 5,
//     render: r => [#r.label],
//   )
//
// NO JSON ISLAND, and this is a rule rather than an implementation detail. Every
// faceted or searched field rides as a `data-<field>` attribute on the row
// carrying it, so the payload and the markup cannot disagree — and with no
// JavaScript the rendering is a complete readable list rather than an empty
// container waiting to be filled. The projection's scalar guarantee is exactly
// what makes that generic instead of hand-written per widget.
//
// PANELS TAKE AN INDEX, THEY NEVER BUILD ONE. A page builds one projection and
// passes the projected rows to everything on it. A self-building panel would put
// back the per-view walk of the value store that `tag-index` exists to remove.

#import "base.typ": *

// The scalar rule, policed HERE rather than at the accessor. `ideas(values: true)`
// may legitimately carry arbitrary values for Typst-side rendering — a datetime to
// format, content to place — and this is the boundary where such a value would
// otherwise be stringified into an HTML attribute and read back as nonsense.
#let _attr(field, value) = {

  // WHY LAYOUT IS A SEPARATE ARGUMENT rather than nesting `facets:` itself: the
  // flat list is what a row's `data-<field>` attributes and `render:` are built
  // from, and folding presentation into it would make every caller that never
  // wanted two lines write the nesting anyway.

  // A projected field to order by, ascending. A date projected with
  // `stamp: true` is a zero-padded `[year][month][day]` string, so this is a
  // plain string sort in date order — see `tag-index`.
  sort: none,
  // Rows with no value for the sort field go LAST rather than first. A missing
  // date is not an early one, and an undated row floating to the top of a list
  // sorted by deadline reads as urgent when it is merely unset.
  descending: false,
  // How many rows are VISIBLE before the list scrolls. NOT a data cap: every row
  // stays in the markup. A consuming site had capped its list and hidden the
  // rest, and its own comment records why that was abandoned — it "made the box
  // a preview of the corpus rather than the corpus — you could not reach the
  // thirty-third place without narrowing the query enough to lift it into the
  // top five, and if you did not know its name you could not narrow at all".
  //
  // `none` MEANS IT DOES NOT SCROLL: the list flows down the page for as long as
  // there are matching rows. `#filter-panel` has taken this since it was written —
  // a scroll box earns its place in a widget a reader opens to find one thing, and
  // not in a page's main list, where it cuts a row in half and hides the rest behind
  // a gesture nothing advertises. This function was the odd one out, and `str(none)`
  // is what a caller trying it hit.
