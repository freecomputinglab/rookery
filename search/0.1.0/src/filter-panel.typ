// `#filter-panel` — a panel over the ideas carrying ONE tag, with a hand-named pill
// per tag.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT MORE ARGUMENTS ON `#panel`. That widget facets on PROJECTED FIELDS:
// `facets: ("status", "kind")` reads `r.at(field)` and mints one pill per value any row
// carries. This is the other shape — the rows are "every note tagged `todo`", the pills
// are a list of TAG NAMES the caller writes down, and the same tags come back as chips
// on the row. Neither half is expressible as a facet, and bending `#panel` into both
// would leave one function with two mutually exclusive halves.
//
// IT READS `ideas()` ITSELF, which departs from `panel.typ`'s own banner ("PANELS TAKE
// AN INDEX, THEY NEVER BUILD ONE"), and the departure is the point rather than an
// oversight. That rule exists to stop a per-view walk of the value store; the cost of
// keeping it here would be a wrapper in every consuming site, which is exactly what
// this export was asked for to delete — a site should import one name and call it. The
// walk is one `ideas()` per panel, and a caller that already has rows (because it built
// them from another package's projection) passes them through `rows:` and no walk
// happens at all.
//
// THE ROW IS `#idea-row`, from @rookery/core core. Nothing about the row's markup or
// the chip's shape is written here — that function exists so this file cannot be a
// fourth copy of it.

#import "base.typ": *
#import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": idea-row, ideas

// SHORT AND NUMERIC, matching @rookery/timeline's own `_fmt-day` exactly —
// `27.8.26`, unpadded — so a site running both packages' lists on one page does not
// show two spellings of the same kind of date. Written out here rather than imported,
// because this package has no edge to that one and must not grow one for a format
// string.
#let _fmt-day(d) = d.display("[day padding:none].[month padding:none].[year repr:last_two]")

// The ISO form for the `datetime` attribute — zero-padded, machine-facing, and
// deliberately not what the cell shows.
#let _iso(d) = d.display("[year]-[month]-[day]")

// A row's own tag NAMES, whatever shape rookery handed them in. `ideas()` gives
// `tags` as an array of names; `values: true` adds `tags-dict`, whose KEYS are the
// same names. Reading either means a caller can pass rows from either call.
#let _tags-of(r) = {
  let d = r.at("tags-dict", default: none)
  if d != none { return d.keys() }
  let t = r.at("tags", default: ())
  if type(t) == dictionary { t.keys() } else { t }
}

// THE FLAT ONES ONLY, for `pills: auto`. rookery's three tag surfaces (see
// @rookery/todos' `tags.typ`, which names them) split on exactly this: a FLAT tag
// carries no value because the key IS the fact, and that is the surface that "renders
// as a pill"; a VALUED tag's value is a date, a URL, an id or a bag of metadata, and
// rookery's own convention is that it renders none. So `timeline-log`, `cfp-venue` and
// `submission-work` are things to filter BY KEY, not names a pill can wear — and a
// derived pill row that offered them would be reading a note's data as its vocabulary.
//
// MEASURED on a site with 47 auto-derived pills: six of them were valued keys, and each
// one is a button reading like a namespace.
//
// AN AUTHORED `pills:` LIST IS UNAFFECTED. A caller naming a valued key means it —
// presence-filtering by such a key is legitimate and `#panel`'s tag query does it — so
// this narrows the DERIVATION and nothing else.
//
// WITH NO `tags-dict` there are no values to test, which is a row handed in through
// `rows:` from a plain `ideas()`. Every key is offered, because "flat" is unanswerable
// rather than false, and a caller in that position has `tag-filter:`.
#let _flat-tags-of(r) = {
  let d = r.at("tags-dict", default: none)
  if d == none { return _tags-of(r) }
  d.keys().filter(k => d.at(k) == none)
}

#let filter-panel(
  // Only ideas carrying this tag become rows. `none` means every idea.
  tag: none,
  // Tag names, in order. Each becomes one pill AND, where a row carries it, one chip.
  // AUTHORED rather than derived, which WAS the difference from `#panel`'s facets.
  //
  // `auto` DERIVES THEM: every FLAT tag any listed row carries, sorted — so the pill order
  // is stable across builds, `ideas()` being ordered by id while the set of tags it
  // turns up is not. That is the mode for a panel whose pills should not need
  // maintaining: a tag written on one note today has a pill tomorrow, and nothing
  // anywhere declares the list. Narrow it with `tag-filter:` below, which is how a
  // whole namespaced family stays out.
  //
  // AN AUTHORED LIST IS STILL RIGHT where the pills are a VOCABULARY rather than an
  // inventory — the kinds a note can be, in an order a reader expects, with the
  // subjects left to the text box. Both modes drop a tag no listed row carries.
  pills: (),
  // WHICH TAGS EARN A PILL, as a predicate over the tag name — `t => bool`, `none` for
  // all of them. It NARROWS and cannot widen: a tag no row carries has no pill either
  // way.
  //
  //   tag-filter: t => not t.starts-with("venue-")
  //
  // WHY A PREDICATE AND NOT A LIST OF NAMES TO EXCLUDE. With `pills: auto` the whole
  // value of the row is that nothing declares it, and a list of exclusions is that same
  // maintenance burden back again — one entry per tag instead of one per pill. What a
  // caller wants to drop is a FAMILY, and its families are its own: a namespacing
  // prefix here, some other scheme on the next site. A predicate says it in one line
  // and needs no vocabulary from this package.
  //
  // IT APPLIES TO AN AUTHORED LIST TOO, so a blacklist beats a pill written by hand:
  // one question, one answer, whichever way the list arrived.
  //
  // THE SAME ARGUMENT NAME @rookery/todos' `#filter-panel` takes for its own `tag`
  // group. Two panels and two derivations — that one also drops the todo namespace and
  // the epics — but one word for "which tags earn a pill", so a site can hold the
  // predicate in one `let` and hand it to both.
  tag-filter: none,
  // WHICH TAGS BECOME CHIPS on the rows, if not the pills. `auto` is the pill list when
  // that list is authored, and NOTHING when it is derived.
  //
  // THAT ASYMMETRY IS ABOUT THE GRID rather than about tags. `#idea-row` is
  // `<gutter> 1fr auto auto` and the chip strip is the last `auto`, so a chip per tag
  // makes the strip as wide as the widest row's whole tag list and squeezes every title
  // on the page to pay for it. An authored list is short by construction and was always
  // safe there; a derived one is however long the corpus is. @rookery/todos' panel
  // leaves its derived `tag` group off its badge strip for exactly this reason.
  //
  // SO A PANEL CAN HAVE BOTH: `pills: auto` for a filter that needs no maintaining, and
  // `chips: ("todo", "meeting", ..)` for the few tags worth reading off a row. A row
  // wears every tag it has as an `idea-tag-<tag>` class either way, so theming is
  // untouched by anything decided here.
  chips: auto,
  // HOW TWO PRESSED PILLS COMPOSE. `"any"` (the default) keeps a row carrying EITHER,
  // so a second pill widens; `"all"` keeps only a row carrying BOTH, so it narrows.
  //
  // WHY "any" IS THE DEFAULT, and it is a fact about real pill rows rather than a
  // preference: the tags worth making pills of are usually mutually exclusive in
  // practice — one epic per todo, one sort per submission — so intersecting two of
  // them returns nothing at all. A filter whose commonest two-press outcome is an
  // empty list teaches a reader not to press twice.
  //
  // `"all"` IS STILL RIGHT where tags genuinely stack: `urgent` and `epic-jobs` are
  // both true of one todo, and a reader pressing both means the conjunction.
  //
  // NOT THE SAME ARGUMENT AS `match:` above, which scopes WHICH NOTES ARE ROWS before
  // any pill is pressed. This one composes the pills. Two questions, two arguments —
  // and the names deliberately differ so a call site cannot read as if one did both.
  pill-match: "any",
  // Pre-computed rows. When given, `tag:` is not consulted and no registry walk
  // happens — this is the composition hook: a caller can hand in rows built from
  // another package's projection (a log-derived queue, say) and pass a `when:` adapter
  // that reads whatever field that projection put the date in.
  rows: none,
  // THE DATE IS AN ADAPTER, not a field name, and it is what lets one panel answer two
  // questions. The default is rookery core's own `created` — when the note was written
  // — which is what an index of open work wants. A caller ordering by something derived
  // passes its own reader. Returns a `datetime` or `none`.
  when: r => r.at("created", default: none),
  // HOW A TAG READS, in a pill and in a chip. The default turns a hyphen into a space,
  // because a hyphen is a naming convention rather than something a reader should have
  // to see. A caller whose tags share a namespacing prefix strips it here:
  //
  //   tag-display: t => if t.starts-with("epic-") { t.slice(5) } else { t }
  //
  // DISPLAY ONLY, and that is the whole contract: the row's `idea-tag-<tag>` class,
  // the chip's own class and the pill's `data-panel-tag` all keep the REAL tag, so a
  // project's theme rules and this package's script are untouched by anything written
  // here. Two tags that display the same string produce two pills reading alike, which
  // the panel cannot detect and will not warn about — that is the caller's to avoid.
  //
  // NOT `label:`, which is what this argument was called for about an hour: `label` is
  // already a rookery ROW FIELD (a note's own name, read three lines below as
  // `r.at("label")`), so one word meant two things inside one function.
  tag-display: t => t.replace("-", " "),
  // HOW MANY ROWS SHOW BEFORE THE LIST SCROLLS, and `none` means IT DOES NOT: the
  // list flows down the page for as long as there are matching rows. Not a data cap
  // either way — every row is in the markup regardless, and the cap is only a height.
  //
  // A scroll box earns its place in a widget a reader opens to find one thing (the
  // panel's own ancestor is a search dropdown). It does not earn it in a page's main
  // list, where it cuts a row in half and hides the rest behind a gesture nothing
  // advertises — which is the same argument `#upcoming` makes for having no cap at all.
  // WHICH END OF THE DATE COLUMN LEADS. `"newest"` (the default) puts the most recent
  // date first, which is what a `created` column wants — an index of work is a list of
  // what was written lately. `"soonest"` puts the earliest first, which is what a
  // DEADLINE column wants: a date already behind you belongs at the TOP, because an
  // overdue row is the most urgent thing on the page, and next week's should not be
  // below next year's.
  //
  // A CALLER PASSING `when:` USUALLY WANTS `"soonest"`, and the two are not folded into
  // one argument on purpose: `when:` says WHICH date and this says WHICH WAY, and a
  // caller reading `created` descending is a real combination (the default).
  //
  // UNDATED ROWS SORT LAST IN BOTH, and that is the reason this is a partition rather
  // than a `.rev()` of one sorted list: reversed, the undated rows — last ascending —
  // would land at the TOP, reading as the most recent thing on the page.
