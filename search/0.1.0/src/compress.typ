// ---- The corpus pass — a note compressed to its most distinctive terms -----
//
// What `#search-index` puts in a row's `body`. NOT a prose prefix: that field is
// MATCH-ONLY now (the modal's preview pane fetches the note's own minted page
// rather than excerpting the island — see `#search-modal`), so its bytes are
// spent on the terms that DISTINGUISH a note instead of on whatever the note
// happened to open with.
//
// MEASURED on weeknotes.ohrg.org (56 notes): the old 1200-cluster prefix cap
// shipped 48,587 of 76,420 body chars, so 36% of the corpus prose was not
// findable in the browser AT ALL. At `body-terms: 48` and `df-ceiling: 40` the
// terms cost 18,791B and the whole island ~24,190B, against 54,610B before — 44%
// of the old cost, with whole-note coverage. 38 of the 56 notes hit the 48-term
// cap, so the budget is real and not slack.
//
// NO WEIGHTS ARE SHIPPED. Position is the weight, and `body-score` reads rank.
// MEASURED and this is why: in notes this short almost every term has tf=1, so
// the weight collapses to idf, and idf is a property of the TERM (identical
// across notes), so a digit-per-term weight string cost 11% overhead to
// distinguish only the top two or three terms. Rank carries what is left.
//
// BUILD TIME ONLY, and it stays that way: none of this is ported to JavaScript
// and none of it should be, because the browser matches against the RESULT.
// `body-score`/`bodyScore` are the only pair that needs porting.

// The stopword FLOOR — not the filter. MEASURED: the island is 15,112B with this
// list and 15,047B without it, a 0.4% difference, because the df ceiling below
// already catches nearly everything on it. It is here for a SMALL rookery, where
// too few notes exist for df to carry any signal at all.
//
// Function words only, and nothing shorter than three clusters: `_tokenize`'s
// length floor has already dropped `a`, `is`, `of`, `to`, `it` and the rest
// before this dictionary is consulted, so listing them would be dead weight.
// That is also why `im` and `id` are absent while `ive`/`wasnt`/`dont` are here —
// the contractions appear in their apostrophe-stripped form, since an apostrophe
// never survives tokenization.
//
// TYPOS ARE NOT FILTERED, deliberately: `somethign` is in the note, and a reader
// who typed the same typo should find it.
//
// A DICTIONARY, not an array, for the same reason as `_prec`: the question asked
// of every token is a key test, and `t in _stopwords` is that test, where array
// membership is a scan of a hundred strings per token.
#let _stopwords = {
  // Parenthesised, and it has to be: in Typst CODE mode a line break ends the
  // statement, so a continuation line opening with `+` is read as a unary plus
  // on a fresh expression — MEASURED, `cannot apply unary '+' to string`.

// One note's plain-text body to candidate terms, in FIRST-APPEARANCE order with
// duplicates KEPT — `_compress-corpus` counts them for tf.
//
// Lowercased, split on every non-alphanumeric cluster EXCEPT `.` and `-`, which
// are kept INSIDE a token. MEASURED against this corpus: `0.5.1`,
// `rheo-context`, `eco-marxist` and `marrow.typ` are exactly what a reader
// searches for, and splitting them yields `5`, `1`, `rheo`, `context` — none of
// which is the thing wanted. A LEADING `.` is kept too, so `.marrow.typ` survives
// verbatim; the dotted form then answers both queries, a dotless one still being
// a substring of it, where the stripped form answers only the dotless query. A
// TRAILING `.`/`-` is stripped, that one being sentence punctuation rather than
// part of the term (`code.` -> `code`, `well-` -> `well`). The cost of one rule
// doing both is that `word.Next` with no space after the stop reads as a single
// term; a plain-text body puts a space there.
//
// `_` IS A SPLITTER, not a token character. `.` and `-` are the two exceptions
// and the set is closed — every addition is another character a reader has to
// type exactly to match what the build kept.
//
// Dropped: tokens under 3 clusters, bare digit runs, and the stopword floor. A
// bare digit run is `^[0-9]+$` and nothing looser, so `0.5.1` and an id like
// `26w30` are NOT bare numbers and survive — they are among the most distinctive
// terms a note has.
//
// NO STEMMING, no accent folding, no language detection: documented non-goals.
// Each would be a rule the READER now has to reproduce in the search box, since
// the browser matches raw substrings against whatever the build kept.

// The corpus-wide pass: `bodies` in, one space-joined term string per body out,
// SAME ORDER, so the caller zips the result back onto its rows positionally.
//
// THE SIGNATURE TAKES BODIES, NEVER ROWS, and that is a build-cost decision, not
// a matter of taste. `#search-index` runs on EVERY output page, so this pass is
// called once per page. MEASURED (typst 0.15.1, 2026-08-17) with a pure function
// doing ~285 ms of dictionary work, called from one document: an empty document
// costs 42 ms, ONE call 327 ms, THIRTY calls with an IDENTICAL argument 287 ms —
// the same as one, i.e. free — and THIRTY calls with ONE ARGUMENT DIFFERING
// 6242 ms, about 21x. Typst memoises a pure call keyed on its ARGUMENTS, so this
// pass costs once per build as long as every argument is page-invariant.
//
// An `ideas()` row is NOT page-invariant: `href` is depth-relative, so a nested
// vertebra's rows differ from a top-level page's. Hand this the whole rows array
// and every page is a cache miss — the 6242 ms column. `id` and `body` are the
// stable fields; `bodies` is the projection of the only one this needs. DO NOT
// "simplify" it back to taking rows: nothing fails, no test goes red, the build
// time is silently multiplied by the page count. That is exactly how bead
// rheo-packages-ngx was missed.
