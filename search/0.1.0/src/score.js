// Same rule as `search-ideas`: match on the id AND the title first (tier 0),
// take the better of the two; failing that, match on the body (tier 1) via
// `bodyScore`. Every tier-0 row ranks above every tier-1 row; within a tier,
// best score first, ties broken by id so the order is stable.
//
// `row.body` MISSING IS THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION OF `body-search: false`, not
// merely tolerated: `#search-index(body-search: false)` omits the field, this
// reads it as `""`, and `bodyScore("", q)` is `null` for every non-empty query,
// so no row can reach tier 1 and the browser searches ids and titles only. Keep
// the `?? ""` and keep `bodyScore` returning `null` on an absent term match —
// between them they are what makes the switch need no JavaScript counterpart.
// It also covers an older island that never carried bodies at all.
// A LEADING `tags:` EXPRESSION IS EXTRACTED, NOT SCORED. The query is split once
// before the loop — the tag expression becomes a PREDICATE on each row, and the
// residual text is what the two tiers rank. `_rank`'s Typst twin does exactly
// this, in the same place and the same order, which is what `tier parity` pins.
//
// The predicate runs FIRST, ahead of every scorer, so a note the tags exclude is
// never scored at all. And it stays a predicate: no third tier, no score bonus
// for a tag hit, no perturbation of the tier/sort/limit block below. A tag says
// WHICH notes are in the corpus; the residual text says how they rank.
//
// `row.tags ?? []` for the same reason `row.body ?? ""` is there: an older
// island, or a row for a note with no tags, simply has no key — `#search-index`
// omits it rather than shipping `[]` per row.
//
// With a tag expression and NO residual text (`tags:draft` on its own), `q` is
// `""`, `score(hay, "")` is 0 for every survivor, and they all land in the name
// tier at score 0. THAT tie no longer breaks by id alone: for `q === ""` (a bare
// `""` query too) `dateCmp` below breaks it by `row.created` first, newest
// first, undated last — the JS twin of `_rank`'s date branch in `src/lib.typ`,
// which mirrors `_sort-ids` in rookery's own `src/pure.typ`. A REAL query
// (`q !== ""`) is untouched: ties there still break by id alone, exactly as
// before.
//
// `row.created` is ALREADY the zero-padded `"[year][month][day]"` stamp
// `#search-index` ships (see its comment in `src/lib.typ`) — never a raw date
// object — so lexicographic string comparison is numeric-order comparison,
// with no parsing needed here.
//
// THE KEY IS `created`, not `updated`, since 0.6.0: rookery dropped its
// `updated` field, and the island key renamed with it rather than shipping a
// name that disagreed with its contents.
