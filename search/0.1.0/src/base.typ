// Whether we are compiling under rheo and to what, the theme rookery
// publishes, and the argument validators several public functions share.
//
// EVERY OTHER MODULE IMPORTS THIS ONE and it imports nothing, which is what
// keeps the module graph a DAG.


// ---- Target detection — a deliberate copy of rookery's ---------------------
//
// The originals are `_rheo-ctx` and `_target` in `rookery/0.4.0/src/lib.typ`,
// where they are underscore-private. They are copied rather than exported and
// imported: six lines of `sys.inputs` read, against making rookery widen its
// public surface with something no author would ever call. `sys.inputs` is
// readable from any package's scope, so the copy behaves identically.
//
// `std.target()` reports EPUB as "html"; rheo's own context distinguishes
// them. `std.target()` rather than a bare `target()`, because rheo injects its
// `target()` polyfill into each vertebra's scope, not into package scope — and
// that read REQUIRES `--features html`, which every build of a project using
// this package therefore needs.
//
// Keep in step with rookery's. If that pair changes, this one changes too.
#let _rheo-ctx() = sys.inputs.at("rheo-context", default: none)

#let _target() = {
  let c = _rheo-ctx()
  if c != none and "target" in c { c.target } else { std.target() }
}

// ---- The rookery theme — inherited, not copied ----------------------------
//
// This package's stylesheet reads rookery's own custom properties before its
// literals — `var(--rookery-search-border, var(--idea-border-color, ...))` and
// friends — so a site that themes its notes tints the search UI to match with no
// second configuration. That used to require this package to carry its own copy
// of rookery's theme table and inject it as an inline `style` on `#search-bar`'s
// span and `#search-modal`'s dialog, because neither has a `.idea-*` ancestor to
// inherit from and rookery only emitted the properties on its own containers.
//
// Rookery now ALSO publishes the configured theme once per page as a
// document-scope `<style>:root { --idea-*: ...; }</style>` rule (see the banner
// above `_THEME-KEYS`/`_theme`/`_themed` in `rookery/0.4.0/src/lib.typ`). Custom
// properties inherit down the WHOLE DOM from `:root`, so `#search-bar` and
// `#search-modal` see the theme for free with no private copy of the table and
// no state-key contract to keep in step. MEASURED 2026-08-18: `getComputedStyle`
// on both elements resolves `--idea-border-color` correctly via that inheritance
// alone, with no inline style of their own.

// Lowercase, and `-`/`_` read as a space. Applied to the HAYSTACK AND THE
// QUERY, which is what makes an id findable by how a person types it: the note
// `flat-ids` matches "flat ids", and the exact string "flat-ids" still matches
// too, because both sides collapse to the same thing. Folding only the
// haystack would have broken the second case — the query's literal `-` would
// find no `-` left to match.
//
// Deliberately NOT accent-folding: MEASURED, "cafe" does not match "Café", and
// fixing that means Unicode normalisation the JavaScript port would have to
// reproduce exactly. Recorded as a known limitation in the readme instead.
#let _fold(s) = lower(s).replace("-", " ").replace("_", " ")

// ---- Reading a row, however rookery handed it over ------------------------

// A row's own tag NAMES. `ideas()` gives `tags` as an array of names and
// `values: true` adds `tags-dict`, whose keys are those same names, so reading
// either means a caller may pass rows from either call. A row with neither
// field is untagged, and therefore matches no tag expression at all.
#let _row-tags(r) = {
  let d = r.at("tags-dict", default: none)
  if d != none { return d.keys() }
  let t = r.at("tags", default: ())
  if type(t) == dictionary { t.keys() } else { t }
}

// The default haystack a text input filters on: the row's label, name and body,
// joined. Searching the BODY is what finds a note by a phrase inside it rather
// than by its title.
#let _row-haystack(r) = (
  r.at("label", default: ""),
  r.at("name", default: ""),
  r.at("body", default: ""),
).filter(s => s != "" and s != none).join(" ")

// A `datetime` as the zero-padded `[year][month][day]` string every date sort
// here compares, or `none` for an undated row. The padding is what makes a
// plain string sort a date sort, with no `datetime` comparison anywhere.
#let _date-stamp(d) = if d == none { none } else { d.display("[year][month][day]") }

// ---- Argument validators shared by more than one public function ----------
//
// `tags`, `match` and `body-search` are checked identically by several of this
// package's public functions, each of which used to carry its own six-line
// `assert` and its own copy of the message. MEASURED at 0.4.0: 18 assert blocks
// in this file, `tags` written out four times and `match` four.
//
// `where` is the caller's own name as it already appears in the message, so the
// text a reader sees is byte for byte what it was — possessive included, since
// `#search-ideas'` and `#search-index's` are both correct for their nouns.
//
// A DELIBERATE COPY of `@rookery/core`'s three, not an import of them, for the
// same reason `_target` above is a copy: these say `@rookery/search:` and
// belong to this package's messages. Importing an internal of another package to
// save nine lines would couple the two on something neither documents.
//
// `limit` and `class` are NOT here. They are checked by `#search-bar` and
// `#search-modal`, which are being folded onto one shared core in their own
// bead — deduplicating them here would only move the same lines twice. And
// `#search-ideas`' `limit` is a different check anyway: it accepts 0, the UI's
// does not.
