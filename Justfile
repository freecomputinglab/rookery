# A Typst import spec has to be a literal, so `@rookery/<pkg>:<x.y.z>` is written
# out by hand in every readme, every doc comment, every `.marrow.typ` and every
# cross-package import — and nothing but this recipe checks any of them against
# the manifest that defines the version. CI derives the release tag from
# `typst.toml`, so a version directory cut by copying and bumping only the
# manifest publishes a package whose own marrow imports its PREDECESSOR: it
# resolves to the old code where that is installed and fails outright where it
# is not.
#
# Three rules, all of them things that have gone wrong at least once:
#   - a spec naming its OWN package must name the version its manifest declares;
#   - a spec naming ANOTHER package must name a version that exists here;
#   - `<name>/<version>/` is the layout (CLAUDE.md), so the directory must match.
#
# Hidden files are searched on purpose: `.marrow.typ` carries the import that
# mints every page, and it is the one place a stale spec silently produces no
# output at all. `grep -r` reads dotfiles by default, so this needs no flag for
# them — unlike the `rg` this recipe used to be written with.
#
# GREP AND SED, NOT RIPGREP, and that is the whole reason this recipe reads the way
# it does. MEASURED: every run of the `check` workflow failed with
# `line 32: rg: command not found` (runs 32126839338 and 32127008271) — `rg` is not
# on GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` image, while it is in this repo's devShell, so the
# recipe passed for everyone locally and had never once run in CI. A lint that only
# works on the author's machine is not a lint. Installing ripgrep on the runner
# would have fixed the symptom and left the recipe needing a tool the check does
# not otherwise want; `grep -rEon` plus one `sed` needs nothing that is not on
# every POSIX box.
#
# THE THREE rg FEATURES THAT HAD TO BE REPLACED, so nobody reintroduces them:
#   - `-r '$1'` capture replacement -> `sed -n 's/.../\1/p'`;
#   - `--hidden` -> unnecessary, `grep -r` already reads dotfiles;
#   - `--no-ignore-vcs` + `-g '!dist'` -> `--exclude-dir`. rg skips gitignored
#     paths by default and had to be told not to; grep never skipped them and has
#     to be told to. Same list, opposite default.

# Cuts `<pkg>/<new>/` from `<pkg>/<old>/` and rewrites every version this repo
# writes out by hand, so a release is one command rather than dozens of edits
# that `check-versions` can only catch AFTERWARDS. MEASURED before this existed:
# cutting rookery and rookery-search 0.3.0 -> 0.4.0 is 84 literal specs, 42 of
# them doc comments in one file.
#
# `.github/workflows/check.yml` is rewritten too, and that is the whole reason
# this recipe cannot be a one-line `sed`. `check-versions` walks `*/*/` only, so
# the CI file is invisible to it while hardcoding the version PATHS it tests
# (`cd core/0.3.0 && just test`, the package-cache assertion, `demo/pure`).
# A cut that misses it leaves CI exercising the PREVIOUS version and reporting
# green for code nobody ran.
#
# The OLD directory is never touched: every published version stays in the tree,
# because a release tag is cut per manifest and an edit to an already-released
# directory can never be published again.
#
# Sibling pins are PRINTED, not rewritten. `@rookery/a:1.0.0` inside package `b` is
# legal as long as `a/1.0.0/` exists, so whether a sibling should follow the bump
# is a judgement per package — the demo of an unrelated package may well want to
# stay where it is.
