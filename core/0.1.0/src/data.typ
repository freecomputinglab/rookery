//
//   #let INDEX = tag-index((
//     cycle:    (family: "cycle-"),                 // flat-tag family -> "26-27"
//     kind:     (family: "venue-", one-of: KINDS),  // -> "postdoc"

//   ))
//
//   #context ideas(index: INDEX)   // rows carry .cycle .kind .deadline .stage
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now there were two accessors and nothing between them:
// `ideas()` strips tag VALUES and publishes only names (see the `tags:` field
// above for the measured reason), and `tag-data()` hands back every value of
// every note. So a view needing three tag values per row had to walk the entire
// value store. MEASURED in a consuming project: four separate views on one page
// each opened with `let store = tag-data()` and then looked up per row — four
// full walks of the corpus to read a handful of fields.
//
// SCALARS ONLY, AND ASSERTED. That assert is the whole contract, not a
// nicety. The ban on values riding a row exists because a value is ARBITRARY —
// content in a row is a silent `json.encode` blob. A projection makes values
// NARROW and CHECKED instead, which is what lets them back on safely: a
// projected field is guaranteed encodable as JSON and as an HTML attribute.
//
// ONE WALK. The index is resolved once for the whole `ideas()` call, not per
// row and not per view. Callers are expected to build ONE index per page and
// pass it to everything on it; nothing here caches, because a self-caching
// accessor would put the four-walk problem straight back behind a nicer name.

// The reserved row fields a projection may not shadow. Naming a field `href`
// and silently replacing every link on the page is the failure this prevents.
#let _ROW-FIELDS = (

// Three extractor forms and no more. Each may carry `stamp: true`.
//
// NOT `as:`. MEASURED on typst 0.15.1: `as` is a reserved keyword and
// `(key: "x", as: "date")` fails to parse with "expected named or keyed pair,
// found string" — so the conversion flag cannot wear the name that reads best.
//
//   (key: "<tag key>")      that tag's value, or none
//   (family: "<prefix>")    the first flat tag whose key starts with the prefix,
//                           prefix stripped; `one-of:` restricts AND orders the
//                           candidates, so a note carrying two of a family
//                           resolves to the earliest LISTED rather than to
//                           whichever `.keys()` happens to yield first — tags
//                           are unordered as of 0.5.0 and nothing may depend on
//                           their order
//   (from: <function>)      called with the note's whole tag dictionary
//
// `from:` is not a convenience. A derived value — "the current stage of a dated
// log", "how far this got" — is a COMPUTATION, not a tag value, and the log it
// reads can never ride on a row under the rule above. This form is the only way

// STABLE fields rather than the internal record:
//
//   (id:      "idea:etal",     // the full id, prefix included
//    name:    "etal",          // the id with the prefix stripped
//    title:   [Et al.],        // the title as CONTENT, or none

//    tags:    ("note", "draft"), // as the author gave them, () if untagged
//    body:    "Et al. is ...", // the note's body as plain text, "" if empty
//    href:    "ideas/etal.html", // depth-relative, or none — see `note-href`
//    page:    "ideas/etal.html", // site-root-relative, or none — see `note-path`
//    created: datetime or none)
//
// `tags` is the note's tag NAMES, every key including the valued ones, and
// TAGS ARE UNORDERED as of 0.5.0: key order is unspecified and nothing may
// depend on it. A consumer wanting a stable sequence sorts them itself.
// The VALUES are not here — `tag-data()` below hands over the whole store.
//
// `#tags-of(name)` exposes ONE note's tags too, and still does. This field is
// the bulk form and the cheap one: `tags-of` resolves `_registry.final()` once
// PER NOTE, where `ideas()` resolves it once for the whole pass — and
// `@rookery/search`'s `#search-index` runs on every page of a site, so the
// difference is one state resolution per note per page against one per page.
//
// NOT exposed IN BULK: `raw`, `body`-as-CONTENT and `links`. `body` above is
// a plain STRING derived from `raw` — matchable and excerptable, but not
// renderable, so returning it in an array of every note in the rookery does
// not make a consumer a second transclusion engine the way handing out every
// note's content here would; `links` is backlink plumbing that `.marrow.typ`
// already owns. Add fields here when a consumer genuinely needs them — this
// list is a contract other packages depend on, so removing one is a breaking
// change.
//
// A SINGLE note's body-as-content IS available, on request: `#idea-body(name)`
// below renders one note at a time, the same rendering `#window` gives it —
// links, styling, footnotes, citations — for a consumer that wants to show
// the actual note rather than describe it. The distinction is bulk vs.
// one-at-a-time: `#ideas()` handing out `title` (content) for the WHOLE
// rookery would already be the transclusion-engine problem above if it
// contained the full body instead of a heading; asking for one note's body
// by name is what `#window` has always let an author do explicitly, and
// `#idea-body` is that same permission, minus the chrome.
//
// `tags:`/`match:` narrow the corpus to the notes carrying a tag, and are the
// SAME pair `#window` takes, with the same meanings, through the same shared
// `_tag-pred`: `tags` is `none`, one string or an array; `match` is "any" (the
// default) or "all". They exist because the workaround does not scale and does
// not reach far enough — `ideas().filter(e => "phd" in tags-of(e.name))` works
// and is VERIFIED, but it costs one `_registry.final()` read per row, and
// `#search-bar` builds its index internally with no hook for a caller's filter
// at all.
//
// Filtered BEFORE the `.map`, so a note that is dropped never pays for its
// `_body-plain`/`_note-href`/`_plain` conversions. That is the whole reason the
// parameter is here rather than left to a caller's own `.filter`.
//
// `index:` takes a `tag-index(..)` projection and merges its declared fields
// onto every row — the supported way to filter or sort on a tag VALUE without
// walking `tag-data()`. See that function above for the scalar contract.
//
// `values: true` adds a `tags-dict` field holding the note's WHOLE tag
// dictionary, values included. THREE TIERS, and the narrow one is the default so
// nobody pays for what they did not ask for:
//
//   default          tag NAMES only               free
//   index: SPEC      declared fields, scalar      one walk, only what is named
//   values: true     the whole tag dictionary     the full value store
//
// This tier is not new capability — it is exactly what `tag-data()` already
// returns. What changes is that it arrives ATTACHED TO THE ROW instead of
// needing a keyed lookup per row, and it is paid for only when asked.
//
// IT EXISTS SO THE NARROW DEFAULT IS A DEFAULT AND NOT A RESTRICTION. A
// projection is asserted-scalar, which is what makes it safe for a browser
// panel; but requiring one before a view can render a list would make this
// accessor hostile. Typst-side rendering legitimately wants arbitrary values: a
// datetime to format, a back-pointer id to follow, a path to render as `raw`, and
// the full key list to emit one CSS class per tag.
//
// THE SCALAR RULE IS ENFORCED AT THE PANEL, NOT HERE. A value from this tier
// cannot cross into an HTML `data-` attribute or a JSON island without going
// through `tag-index` first, and the consumer emitting attributes is what says so
// — see `@rookery/search`'s panel. Nothing here polices it, because
// Typst-side use is legitimate and unrestricted.
//
// IT COMPOSES WITH `tags:`, which is what keeps it from being a cliff:
// `ideas(tags: "submission", values: true)` narrows FIRST and attaches values
// only to the survivors, so the cost is proportional to what was asked for rather
// than to the corpus.
//
// Must be called INSIDE a `#context` block (it reads `_registry.final()`); it
// is not itself a context function, because a context function can only return
// content and the whole point here is to return data.
