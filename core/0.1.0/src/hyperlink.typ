// ---- #hyperlink — a plain link to a note, page-or-anchor -------------------
//
// `#hyperlink("etal")[see this]` links to note "etal"'s own minted page when
// one exists, falling back to its in-context anchor otherwise (same
// preference the permalink and `#window` already carry, via
// `_resolve-dest`). `link-to: "anchor"` forces the anchor unconditionally —
// pass it per call, or `.with()` it for a whole-document default (see
// below). Name resolution is `_norm`'s: bare or full, string or label —
// `"etal"`, `"idea:etal"`, `<etal>`, `<idea:etal>` all reach the same note.
// Existence is checked eagerly, so a typo'd name fails at the call site
// rather than producing a dangling link.
//
// THE SAME FUNCTION is also `@idea:x`'s renderer. A note's label lives on a
// hidden anchor FIGURE, so a bare `@idea:etal` would otherwise resolve to
// that figure and render as a bare figure NUMBER, useless to a reader. This
// package installs no document template by design (the author just imports
// and calls `#idea`/`#window`/`#hyperlink`), so there is nowhere to put a
// `show ref:` rule implicitly; it must be an exported rule the author opts
// into:
//
//   #import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": idea, window, hyperlink
//   #show ref: hyperlink                          // the default: the note's own minted page
//   #show ref: hyperlink.with(link-to: "anchor")   // in-context anchor, like #hyperlink(..., link-to: "anchor")
//
// ONE function serves both call shapes via an argument sink, the same way
// `#idea[body]`/`#idea("name")[body]` do: Typst's `show ref:` always calls
// its rule with exactly the `ref` element as the sole argument, so a single
// `content` positional whose `.func()` is `ref` means "installed as a show
// rule" — an author can never construct that value by hand (`@label` is
// markup-only syntax, not a callable `ref(...)` constructor), so the two
// shapes cannot collide. That also lets `link-to:` double as the one knob
// for both an explicit `#hyperlink(...)` call and the `show ref:` rule,
// where the previous two-functions-not-one design (`link-to-page`/
// `link-to-anchor`, each a thin wrapper choosing a hardcoded mode) needed a
// separate export per mode instead.
//
// References to anything else (an ordinary figure, a heading, ...) pass
// through untouched via the `else { it }` branch below — checking
// `e.kind == "rheo-idea-anchor"` on the RESOLVED element, not the label's
// text, is what makes this safe to install as a document-wide `show ref:`
// with no narrower selector: it already only touches rookery refs, whatever
// `prefix:` the document is using. A selector-level scope (`ref.where(...)`)
// can't do this instead — `.where()` matches a static field value (one exact
// label), not "resolves to a rookery anchor", which is only knowable by
// resolving the reference. Without the rule, `@idea:x` still compiles — it
// just shows a number; an explicit `#hyperlink("x")[text]` remains
// unaffected either way (a `show ref:` rule only ever touches `ref`
// elements, never the `link` a direct call like this one produces).
//
// CUSTOM TEXT: `@idea:x[custom text]` (or `#ref(<idea:x>, supplement: [...])`)
// sets `it.supplement`, which the ref-mode branch prefers over the note's
// own title whenever it is not `auto` — `auto` is what an unadorned
// `@idea:x` leaves it at, the signal to fall back to the title/raw-id
// default. An explicit call has no such fallback chain: its body is
// whatever the caller wrote, always.
//
// MEASURED CORRECTION to this bead's own sketch: it assumed the registry
// stored a dict with a `.title` field directly. It stores `(title:, body:)`
// now (added by this bead, since nothing previously persisted the title) —
// see `#idea`'s registration step. A note with no title (the common
// frictionless case) falls back to the bare id text, not a blank link.

// re-expanding forever). Without this, a transcluded body re-emits its
// embedded machinery live: a self-window fails with "maximum show rule depth
// exceeded", and a nested `#idea` inside a transcluded body re-runs its
// registration and counter step, inflating later ids.
//
// REFUTED APPROACH, do not reintroduce: a `state` depth counter around the
// expansion. Measured failing on typst 0.14.2 AND 0.15.1 — a self-window still
// fails identically, because typst hits its nesting cap before the state
// timeline converges.
//
// The `show` rules below are LOCALLY SCOPED to the content this function
// returns — Typst content carries its own style/show-rule modifications
// wherever it is later inserted, so a nested IK/WK marker anywhere inside
// `body` gets reduced when this returned content is finally rendered, no
// matter how many `#window`s later re-embed it.
//
// GOTCHA (measured): do NOT use `it.body.children.first()` to find the
// metadata child — the marker's body begins with a SPACE element whenever the
// markup block spans multiple lines, so `.first()` returns a `space` and
// fails with `space does not have field "value"`. Use
// `.children.find(c => c.func() == metadata)`.
