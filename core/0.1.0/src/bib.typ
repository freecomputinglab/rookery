// Bibliographies: the block an idea renders, and the walk that decides which
// citations are that idea's to render.

// footnote does not — the comments here record what each of those cost to get
// right.

// ---- References blocks ----------------------------------------------------
//
// Typst partitions citations POSITIONALLY: each `#bibliography` claims the
// citations nearest-following it. That is the whole mechanism — one
// bibliography emitted after an idea's body claims exactly that idea's
// citations, with no key filtering needed and nothing to keep in sync.
//
// Builds the call from `_bib`'s parts rather than spreading and adding
// `title:` on top: passing a named argument the spread already carries is a
// duplicate-argument error the moment an author configures their own title.

// ---- Whose citation is it, when a note contains another block? ------------
//
// `_cited-keys` answers "what does this content cite", which is a CONTENT
// question. An idea's own block needs a narrower, POSITIONAL one: "what will
// still be unclaimed by the time my block renders".
//
// A nested `#idea` or `#window` emits a references block of its own, INSIDE the
// enclosing idea's body and therefore BEFORE the enclosing idea's block. Typst
// partitions positionally, so that inner block sweeps up everything preceding
// it — including the enclosing idea's own citations. MEASURED before this fix,
// tracing byte offsets in a minted page for
// `#idea("outer")[Outer cites @beta2021. #window("multi")]`:
//
//      191  CITE Beta 2021       <- Outer's OWN citation
//      684  idea-references      <- the WINDOW's block; claimed all of it
//      998  idea-references      <- Outer's own block, nothing left
//
// and that last one rendered `<h2>References</h2><ul></ul>` — a visible empty
// heading, which is precisely what `_cited-keys` exists to prevent, arriving
// through ordering rather than through content.
//
// So scan the body in order, recording citations AND the nested blocks that
// will claim them. Both IK and WK count: a nested idea emits a block just as a
// window does.
