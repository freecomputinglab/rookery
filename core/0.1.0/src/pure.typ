// What belongs here: a helper whose whole answer comes from what it is handed
// — a string, a content tree, an array. NO `state`, no `context`, no `query`,
// no `sys.inputs`, no target detection, no page handle, no prefix, no theme,
// no registry, no bibliography. Nothing in this file reads document state.
//
// What does NOT belong here: everything that does. Those helpers stay in
// `lib.typ`, whose ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING — a `#let` closure captures the
// scope visible AT DEFINITION time — which is precisely the constraint this
// file's contents do not participate in.
//
// `lib.typ` re-exports every name here (`#import "pure.typ": *`), so the
// underscore-private ones stay importable from `"@rookery/core:0.1.0"` by
// name — `test/units.typ` imports twelve of them that way, and `.marrow.typ`
// imports seventeen of `lib.typ`'s own internals on the same footing.
//
// Order still matters WITHIN this file, for the same definition-time-capture
// reason: `_INLINE-FUNCS` -> `_is-inline` -> `_blocks` -> `_truncate`,
// `_join` -> `_body-text` -> `_body-plain`, and `IK`/`WK` above both footnote
// walkers.
//
// `_std-footnotes`'s `footnote` is TYPST'S BUILT-IN, deliberately: rookery
// defines its own `#footnote` far down in `lib.typ` and nothing here shadows
// the name. Do not import rookery's `footnote` into this file.

// Normalise a name (string or Typst label) to its bare string form, with no
// prefix. Strips a leading "prefix:" when present, so the bare form
// ("etal", <etal>) and the full id ("idea:etal", <idea:etal> — the same id
// `@idea:etal` resolves) name the same note either way: whichever is closer
// to hand — a fresh name to pin, or a full id copied from elsewhere — just
// works. Shared by `#idea` (pinning an explicit id), `#window` (looking one
// up), and `#hyperlink` (linking to one). Defined before the registry below
// because `hyperlink` needs both and must come before `_flatten`, which
// installs it as a `show ref:` rule.

// empty dictionary when there are none — the same emptiness the `idea-tag-<tag>`

// class list and this attribute, so the two cannot disagree about which tags
// are on the element.

// ---- _norm-tags — every accepted `tags:` form, as ONE dictionary -----------
//
// The tag store is a DICTIONARY as of 0.5.0: keys are tag names, values are
// arbitrary Typst values, and a plain tag is one whose value is `none`. This is
// what lets a tag carry metadata — `(depends-on: ("a", "b"))` — instead of only
// naming itself, and it is the primitive `@rookery/todos` and
// `@rookery/timeline` build on.
//
// Four author-facing forms all land here and all normalize to that one shape,
// so nothing downstream has to ask which was written:
//
//   none            -> (:)
//   "draft"         -> (draft: none)
//   ("a", "b")      -> (a: none, b: none)
//   (a: 1, b: none) -> unchanged
//
// `("a", "b")` and `(a: none, b: none)` are therefore THE SAME registry record,
// which matters at `idea.typ`'s duplicate-id check: two pins of one id written
// in different forms must not read as a collision.
//
// Defined above BOTH its callers — `_tag-pred` just below and `_dedup-tag`
// further down — because a `#let` closure captures the scope visible AT
// DEFINITION time, so a helper defined after a caller is invisible to it.
#let _norm-tags(v) = {
  if v == none {
    (:)
  } else if type(v) == str {
    ((v): none)
  } else if type(v) == dictionary {
    v
  } else {
    v.fold((:), (d, t) => { d.insert(t, none); d })
  }

// ---- _split-tag-list — one `--input` value as tag names --------------------
//
// A `sys.inputs` value is ALWAYS a string — Typst's own contract for
// `--input key=value`, not a choice this package made — so a LIST of tags
// arrives as one string and has to be split somewhere.
//
// COMMAS AND/OR WHITESPACE, in any mixture, because
// `--input rookery-exclude="private, protected"` and
// `--input rookery-exclude=private,protected` mean the same thing and neither
// caller should have to know which spelling this package parses.
//
// The `.filter(t => t != "")` is what makes a trailing comma, a doubled
// separator, a leading space and the empty string all harmless: an empty value
// means "no tags", never "one tag whose name is the empty string" — which would
// otherwise be a tag no note can carry and every note could be tested against.
//
// PURE, hence its place in this file: string in, array out, no `sys.inputs` and
// no state. The READ that feeds it is `_input-tags` in `base.typ`, where every
// read of that dictionary already lives.
#let _split-tag-list(s) = {
  if s == none { return () }
  s.split(regex("[,\\s]+")).filter(t => t != "")
}

// ---- _tag-pred — the shared tag filter -----------------------------------
//
// `tags` is `none`, a single string, an array of strings, or a dictionary —
// the same four forms `#idea` takes; `match` is "any" (the default) or "all".
// Returns a predicate over a note's own tag DICTIONARY, or `none` when there is
// nothing to filter by. An EMPTY `tags` is no filter at all rather than a
// filter matching nothing — asking for none of the tags is not the same as
// asking for a tag no note has.
//
// `filter` is a caller's OWN predicate over the same tag dict, ANDed with the
// `tags`/`match` one — both must hold, never either. NAMED and defaulting to
// `none` so the callers with no use for it (`#window`, `ideas()`) keep their
// arity; `#ideas-outline` is the one that offers it, because `tags:`/`match:`
// can say "any of these" and "all of these" and nothing else. It cannot say
// `phd` but NOT `draft`, nor `(phd AND draft) OR todo`. Keyword parameters for
// those would be a filter language grown one special case at a time —
// `exclude:`, then `any-of:`/`all-of:`, then nested-array groups — and a Typst
// function value already IS that language, in the caller's hands.
//
// The predicate sees the TAG DICTIONARY and nothing else: no title, no id, no
// depth. Those are not tag filtering, and handing over a whole outline entry
// would make the entry's shape a public contract this package then has to keep.
//
// THE DICT, not an array of names, as of 0.5.0 — that is what lets a project
// filter on a tag's VALUE rather than only on its presence:
//
//   filter: t => t.at("priority", default: 4) <= 1
//
// BREAKING for a 0.4.1 predicate written against the array. `t => "phd" in t`
// keeps working unchanged (MEASURED: `in` tests dictionary KEYS), but
// `t.map(..)`, `t.any(..)`, `t.all(..)` and `t.at(0)` do not — a dictionary has
// no `.any`/`.all` at all, and its `.at` takes a key, not an index.
//
// Still `none` when neither is set, and that matters — it is what lets
// `_prune-outline` skip its walk entirely for an unfiltered outline. Do not
// replace it with an always-true closure.
//
// Defined HERE, above every caller, rather than beside the first one to want
// it: a `#let` closure captures the scope visible AT DEFINITION time, so a
// helper defined further down is invisible to `#window`. `_blocks` carries the
// same note for the same reason. `#ideas-outline`'s tag filter reuses this —
// do not define a second copy next to it.

    // and no `.all`, so the two branches below would hard-error with

// bottomed-out window link, an outline entry.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. `#idea[body]` — the frictionless, auto-numbered form — used to
// be identifiable only by its `[idea:1]` permalink, and every place that names a
// note for a reader fell back to something unhelpful: the slug, the bare id, or
// (in `#ideas-outline`) skipping the note entirely.
//
// `_body-plain` above is exactly the right source: it walks the body to text and
// collapses every whitespace run to one space, so a multi-block, multi-line body
// arrives here as one clean line with nothing to tidy afterwards.
//
// `.clusters()`, NEVER `s.slice(0, limit)`, and this is measured rather than
// cautious: Typst's `str.slice` takes BYTE offsets and PANICS when one lands
// inside a multi-byte character. A body containing any non-ASCII text — an
// accent, an em dash, one of Typst's own smart quotes — would fail the build at

// Split a body into block-level chunks for `limit:` truncation. A naive
// `body.children.slice(0, limit)` is WRONG: whitespace (`space`/`parbreak`)
// children make it select nothing, and list items are bare `item` children
// with no wrapping `list` element, so a naive slice also cuts lists in half.
// This groups consecutive `item`s into one block and drops whitespace.
// Compares `repr(c.func())` against "space"/"parbreak" because there is no
// public element function to compare those against directly.
//
// THE TWO WHITESPACE KINDS ARE NOT THE SAME BOUNDARY, and treating them as one
// is what stopped the item grouping ever firing. MEASURED (typst 0.15.1) — the
// children of `[Intro. #parbreak() - a - b]` are, in order:
//
//   space text space parbreak space item space item space
//
// Every markup list carries a `space` BETWEEN its items, so clearing
// `prev-item` on `space` cleared it before the next `item` was ever seen: each
// item became its own block and `#window("x", limit: 2)` on an intro plus a
// four-item list showed the intro and ONE bullet, the cut-a-list-in-half
// outcome the grouping exists to prevent. A `space` between two `item`s is list
// punctuation; a `parbreak` between them genuinely ends the list. So only
// `parbreak` resets the run. Both still emit no block of their own.
//
// `item` covers all three list kinds — `-`, `+` and `/ term:` items are all
// `item` children (measured), so one branch groups all three.
//
// MEASURED REGRESSION FIX: every registry body has been through `_flatten`
// since v6y.7, which wraps it in a `show`-rule scope — Typst represents that
// as a `styled` node with `.has("children") == false`, not the `sequence` it
// wraps. Without unwrapping, `_blocks` always fell into the single-block
// fallback below, silently disabling `limit:` truncation for every note.
// `styled` (like `space`/`parbreak`) has no public function value to compare
// against directly, hence `repr(...)`. A `styled` node exposes the wrapped
// content as `.child` — verified this stays a single layer even with two
// `show` rules in the scope (`_flatten` sets exactly two), but loop anyway
// in case that ever changes.
//
// Defined HERE, above `_flatten`, rather than beside `#window` where it is
// also used: `_flatten`'s WK rule applies `limit:` too when it expands a
// nested window, and a `#let` closure captures the scope visible AT
// DEFINITION time.
//
// A `space` between two INLINE siblings is not separator noise either, and
// dropping it is what made truncation rejoin two runs with nothing between
// them. MEASURED on rookery.ohrg.org content: "...three layers, because..."
// came out "...three layers,because..." once a `limit:` slice put a text run
// back against a `raw` span. Between BLOCK-level siblings the gap really is
// drawn by margins rather than content, so there the node must still go.
//
// So inline siblings ACCUMULATE into one block, keeping the `space` nodes
// between them, and only a block-level sibling starts a new one. That is also
// the fix for the count: a body that is one paragraph is now ONE block, so
// `limit: n` counts the blocks the name promises and can no longer cut a
// sentence in half. It is why neither `#idea-body` nor `#search-modal` could
// ship a default `limit:` before.
//
// Inline and block are told apart BY NAME, because typst exposes no predicate.
// MEASURED `repr(func())` values (typst 0.15.1) that decide the shape of the
// test: `raw`, `quote` and `equation` each name BOTH their inline and their
// block form, so those three are asked for their own `block` field instead; a
// `"..."` smartquote arrives as a `sequence`; `#text(gray)[x]` arrives as
// `styled`; `#idea`'s own marker arrives as `metadata`, invisible, and used to
// consume a whole `limit` slot on its own.
//
// UNKNOWN NAMES DEFAULT TO BLOCK, deliberately: an element missing from the
// list then behaves exactly as every element did before the list existed — its
// own block — so the worst a gap in it can do is leave one old dropped space
// in place. The other direction would merge two real blocks into one and make
// `limit:` show more than it was asked for.

// The ONE `limit:` truncation — first `limit` blocks of a body, then a grey
// ellipsis — shared by `_flatten`'s WK expansion, `#window` and `#idea-body`.
// It lived as three verbatim copies, which is exactly the drift the rest of
// this file factors things out to prevent. Defined HERE, beside `_blocks`
// rather than beside `#window`, because a `#let` closure captures the scope
// visible AT DEFINITION time and `_flatten` (below) is one of the three
// callers. A `none` limit means no truncation; the callers assert away `0` and
// negatives before reaching this, so it validates nothing itself.
//
// Joined with `parbreak()`, not with nothing. `_blocks` drops the `parbreak`
// children that separated the blocks — right, because a block is not its
// separator — and putting them back is this join's job. MEASURED before it did:
// a two-block truncation rendered as
// `Only three layers, <code>because</code> derived.Second paragraph here. …`,
// one run of inline content with no space, no break, and no `<p>` wrappers at
// all, where the same note UNtruncated emits one `<p>` per paragraph. Typst's
// HTML export decides paragraphs by the `parbreak`s it finds, so restoring them
// restores the `<p>`s with them.
//
// No separator before the ellipsis, so it trails the last kept block rather
// than standing apart from it. MEASURED, and the two cases differ for a reason:
// after a paragraph it lands INSIDE that `<p>`, which reads as "this paragraph
// continues"; after a grouped list it comes out as its own `<p>` after the
// `</ul>`, because an ellipsis cannot sit inside a list. Both are right.
