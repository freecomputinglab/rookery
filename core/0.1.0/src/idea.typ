// `#idea[body]`, `#idea("name")[body]`, and `#idea(<name>)[body]` all work via

// argument. An unnamed note steps a package-wide counter and takes the
// resulting sequence number as its id; a named note is pinned and does not
// perturb that counter. Either way the note gets: an `idea:<id>` Typst label on
// a hidden referenceable anchor, an HTML heading (only when `title` is given),
// and a registry entry carrying its raw body for `#window` to transclude later.
//
// Defined after `_outbound` above because it calls it at registration time, and
// a `#let` closure captures the scope visible AT DEFINITION time.

  // As of 0.5.0 the normalized shape is a DICTIONARY: keys are tag names,

  // ---- THE EXCLUSION GATE, and it sits HERE for a reason -------------------
  //
  // A note carrying an excluded tag is not hidden, it is ABSENT: no figure, no
  // metadata, no registry entry, no Typst label, no minted page, no `ideas()`
  // row, no search-index entry, no feeds beacon, no outline entry, no backlink.
  // See `_resolve-excluded` (base.typ) for the two channels, how they compose,
  // and why the list is an ARGUMENT rather than a `rookery.with()` state.
  //
  // ABOVE the `figure(kind: IK)` below, and that is the whole architecture of
  // this gate rather than a convenience. FIVE things walk for that marker
  // STRUCTURALLY, before realization — `_flatten`'s IK rule (transclusion.typ),
  // `_outbound` (links.typ), `_std-footnotes` and `_footnotes` (pure.typ), and
  // `_ideas-outline-data`'s `query()` (outline.typ) — so the marker cannot be
  // built and then suppressed. It has to never exist, which means the decision
  // has to be made with NO `#context`, which is why `_resolve-excluded` reads
  // `sys.inputs` and a plain argument instead of a state.
  //
  // TAG KEYS, so a VALUED tag excludes exactly as a plain one does: a tag
  // carrying metadata is no less a tag, the same rule `cls` below follows.
  let excluded = _resolve-excluded(exclude-tags)
  if tags.keys().any(t => t in excluded) {
    // TWO THINGS ONLY, and nothing else. Both are invisible.
    //
    // 1. THE COUNTER STILL STEPS for an unnamed note. Deliberate, not an
    //    oversight: an unnamed note takes its id from this counter, so skipping
    //    the step shifts every LATER unnamed note's id — `ideas/3.html` in the
    //    dev build would silently become `ideas/2.html` in the public one. One
    //    inert content node per excluded note buys stable URLs across every
    //    build variant, which is the whole point of a feature whose output is
    //    several builds of one source tree.
    //
    //    `counter.step()` RETURNS CONTENT: emitted as the block's value here,
    //    never inside a code block whose value is used — the trap recorded
    //    above at the non-excluded path's own `.step()`.
    //
    // 2. THE ID GOES ON `_excluded-ids`, named notes only — an unnamed note has
    //    no id anything could link to by name. That state is what lets
    //    `#window`/`#hyperlink`/`#idea-body` tell "deliberately excluded from
    //    this build" from "typo" and degrade instead of panicking. It holds
    //    STRINGS and nothing else: no body, no title, no tags, nothing to
    //    flatten or serialize, which is what keeps an excluded note free.
    //
    //    The `#context` wrapper is needed because `_pfx()` reads
    //    `_prefix.final()`. Safe here where it is fatal around the figure: this
    //    emits no content, so there is nothing for a structural walk to miss.
    return {
      if not named { counter("rheo-ideas-seq").step() }
      if named {
        context {

          // is the trap the non-excluded path below already records against
          // `doc-date`: an updater closure runs LAZILY, at `.final()` time,
          // where context is unknown — so a `_pfx()` call inside it fails with
          // "can only be used when context is known" the moment any reader
          // resolves this state. MEASURED here: `#window`'s own

  // ---- TITLE vs LABEL, and the distinction is the whole point ---------------
  //
  // A note travels under two names, and conflating them was a real defect:
  //
  //   `title`  the AUTHORED title, `none` when the author gave none. This is what
  //            gets PRINTED AS A HEADING above the note's own body — its card, its
  //            minted page's `<h1>`, a transcluded card's heading.
  //
  //   `label`  what to CALL this note somewhere else: a browser tab, an
  //            `ideas/index.html` row, an `#ideas-outline` entry, a feed item, the
  //            text of a link to it. Authored title flattened to plain text, else
  //            the first 60 characters of the body (`_derived-title`, pure.typ),
  //            else `none`.
  //
  // WHY THEY CANNOT BE ONE VALUE. MEASURED on a real project's content
  // (`phdash/rookery`, which has ten-odd bare `#idea[..]`/`#todo[..]` notes):
  // deriving into `title` printed the body twice —
  //
  //   <h2><span class="idea-title">Call scooter palace about the title</span></h2>
  //   </div>Call scooter palace about the title</div>
  //
  // — and the same on the note's minted page, `<h1>` then `<p>`. An AUTHORED title
  // never does this because it differs from the body; a DERIVED one IS the body,
  // and the reader is already looking at it. So a derived name is only ever useful
  // where the body is absent.
  //
  // THAT THE LABEL IS WANTED is not in doubt: the same phdash template hand-rolls
  // `if r.text == "" { r.name } else { r.title }` in eight places, deriving a name
  // badly because rookery published none. `ideas()` now carries `label` so nobody
  // has to.
  //
  // A STRING, never content, so a consumer can put it in an attribute, a
  // `lower(..)`, a sort key or a JSON index without asking what shape it is.
  //
  // Resolved out here — above the figure, outside every `#context` — so one value
  // reaches BOTH channels a note's names travel by: the `#metadata` payload just
  // below (read by `_flatten`'s IK rule and by `#ideas-outline`) and the registry
  // record in the context block further down. It can live here because
  // `_derived-title` and `_plain` are PURE: no state, no context, no query.
  // NOT NAMED `label`, and this is a hard trap rather than a style choice: a local
  // `let label = ..` SHADOWS Typst's built-in `label()` function for the rest of
  // this function, and `#label(id)` further down (the note's referenceable anchor)
  // then fails with `expected function, found string`. MEASURED: it broke every
  // cross-page `@idea:x` and `#link(label("idea:x"))` in the demo at once, with an
  // error pointing at the anchor rather than at the shadowing binding. The RECORD
  // FIELD is still called `label` — that is the public name — but the local is not.

// ---- #tagged-idea / #tags-of / #tag-value — an idea's tags ----------------
//
// `tagged-idea` is a FACTORY: it returns an `#idea` variant that prepends one
// tag to whatever the caller passed. Define your own vocabulary with it —
//
//   #let note = tagged-idea("note")
//   #let todo = tagged-idea("todo")
//   #let claim = tagged-idea("claim")
//
// — and `#note("x")[...]` is exactly `#idea("x", tags: (note: none))[...]`.
// No new parameter on `#idea`, no recognised set of tags, no subclassing.
//
// REPLACES the hardcoded `note`/`todo` this package exported through 0.4.1.
// Two names could never be the right two, and a project or a package wanting a
// third had to reimplement the forwarding below. `@rookery/todos` builds
// its whole `#todo`/`#epic` surface on this.
//
// The returned function forwards every other argument (level, title, created,
// show-date, show-tags) and the POSITIONAL SINK untouched, so
// `#note[body]`, `#note("name")[body]` and `#note(<name>)[body]` all work
// exactly as the `#idea` forms do.
//
// `value:` is the default this factory binds for its own tag, for a wrapper
// whose tag means something richer than its own presence. A CALLER'S OWN VALUE
// FOR THAT TAG WINS OUTRIGHT — `#todo("x", tags: (todo: (state: "open")))`
// keeps `(state: "open")` — and there is no deep merge between the two.
// `_dedup-tag`'s "already a key" guard is what implements that.
//
// THE TRAP, do not reintroduce: `#let note = idea.with(tags: (note: none))`.
// An explicit `tags:` argument at the call site OVERRIDES a value bound by
// `.with()`, so `#note("x", tags: ("draft",))` would silently drop "note" —
// the tag the caller chose `#note` for in the first place. The closure below
// exists precisely because `.with()` cannot express "merge, don't replace".
// `exclude-tags:` IS TAKEN HERE TOO, AND IT IS REQUIRED, not a nicety. This
// factory's returned closure calls the `idea` captured in PACKAGE scope, so a
// project writing `#let idea = idea.with(exclude-tags: E)` does NOT thereby
// reach `#let note = tagged-idea("note")` — that wrapper would keep hatching
// the very notes the project asked to have excluded, which is the worst failure
// shape available: a silently incomplete exclusion in a published build. Hence
// the documented project pattern is two bindings sharing one list:
//
//   #let EX = ("protected", "private")
//   #let idea = idea.with(exclude-tags: EX)
//   #let note = tagged-idea("note", exclude-tags: EX)
//
// It is named on the RETURNED CLOSURE as well, defaulting to the factory's own
// value, and that is deliberate: without it a caller writing
// `#note("x", exclude-tags: (..))` would land the argument in `..args` and
// Typst would error on a duplicate named argument. With it, the factory binding
// is the default and a call site can still override.

//
//   #context tags-of("etal")   // -> ("note", "draft")
//
// Takes a bare name, a full id or a Typst label — whatever `_norm` accepts,
// which is the same set of forms `#window` and `#hyperlink` take. Returns the
// note's tag NAMES as a flat array, and `()` both for an untagged note and for
// an id that does not exist — a missing note is not an error here, because a
// caller asking "what is this tagged" is filtering, not dereferencing.
//
// EVERY key, valued tags included: a tag that carries metadata is still a tag,
// and this is the "what is this tagged" question. KEY ORDER IS UNSPECIFIED as
// of 0.5.0 — tags are unordered, and nothing may depend on the sequence.
//
// The VALUES are deliberately not here. `tag-value` below fetches one, and
// `tag-data` (data.typ) fetches the whole store in bulk.
//
// Must be called INSIDE a `#context` block: it reads `_registry.final()`. It
// is not itself a context function, because a context function may only
// return content and the whole point here is to return data.

//   #context tag-value("etal", "priority")            // -> 1
//   #context tag-value("etal", "nope", default: 4)    // -> 4
//
// Takes the same name forms `tags-of` takes. Returns `default` when the note
// does not exist, or exists without that key — a missing note is not an error,
// for the same reason it is not one in `tags-of`.
//
// A PLAIN TAG'S VALUE IS `none`, which is indistinguishable from `default:
// none` on a key that is absent. Ask `tags-of` (or `tag-data`) when the
// question is presence rather than value; this function answers "what is it
// set to", and a plain tag is set to nothing.
//
// Must be called INSIDE a `#context` block, same as `tags-of`.
#let tag-value(name, key, default: none) = {

// ---- #footnote — shadows Typst's, scoped to the enclosing idea ------------
//
// Import it alongside `#idea` and write footnotes exactly as before:
//
//   #import "@rookery/core:0.1.0": idea, footnote
//   #idea("etal")[A claim#footnote[The evidence.] worth qualifying.]
//
// Emits nothing on its own — it is an invisible marker. Inside an idea,
// `_footnoted` claims it, numbers it against that idea and lists its body in
// the idea's own Footnotes block. Outside one, the document-wide rule
// `#show: rookery` installs falls back to `std.footnote`, so a footnote in
// ordinary page prose behaves exactly like Typst's: page-wide numbering, body
// in the page's endnote section.
//
// It must NOT call `std.footnote`, step a counter, or emit a `<sup>` — all of
// that belongs to whichever show rule claims the marker, and doing any of it
// here would put a real footnote element in the document that nothing can
// then remove (see the note on FNK above).
#let footnote(body) = [#metadata((rookery-fn: body))<rkfn>]
