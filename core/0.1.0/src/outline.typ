// ---- Page-level links ------------------------------------------------------
//
// `handle -> (note ids that page links to DIRECTLY)`, for the page half of the
// backlinks list. Directly means at depth 0: not inside an `#idea`, and not
// inside a `#window`'s transcluded body (see `_edge`).
//
// This is the one thing in the package that cannot come from the registry.
// The registry holds notes, and a link in a page's own prose belongs to no
// note — so the page itself has to be asked.
//
// ASKED AS A CONTENT QUESTION, and BEACONED, rather than swept out of the
// document with `query`. This used to be one bundle-wide
// `query(metadata|link|ref)` walked in document order with a depth counter, and
// that shape is what put a rookery site over Typst's five-iteration relayout cap.
// The sweep's result builds the backlink list on every page `.marrow.typ` mints,
// and those minted pages replay note bodies — so they emit `link`, `ref` and
// `metadata` elements that the same sweep then sees. The query fed the pages it
// queried, and each round of that costs one iteration of a budget capped at
// `MAX_ITERS = 5` (typst-library/src/introspection/convergence.rs).
//
// MEASURED on an 82-note site, warning counts with ANSI stripped: 4 with the
// sweep, 2 with it stubbed out entirely. Past the cap `state("rheo-handle")`
// reads stop converging, and a note's page-relative href degenerates to ONE
// value shared by every page it is replayed onto — which is how 72 links came
// out `../ideas/<slug>.html` from the site root and 404'd. A converging site
// does not have that problem: verified on a small rookery site, where the same
// stored body yielded `ideas/m.html` at depth 0 and `../ideas/m.html` at depth 1,
// both correct, from unmodified code.
//
// So each vertebra now scans its OWN content — `_page-outbound` below, a plain
// content walk with no introspection at all — and publishes the answer as one
// labelled `metadata` beacon, exactly the shape rheo uses for its own per-vertebra
// metadata. `_page-links` reads `query(<rookery-page-links>)`, a selector a
// minted page never contributes to, so the loop is closed: the input no longer
// grows when marrow mints. `#show: rookery` is what emits it (see `template.typ`),
// which is also what scopes it to vertebrae — a minted page applies the project's
// `idea-page-template`, not `rookery()`, so it publishes nothing here.
//
// Four shapes count, the same four `_outbound` counts inside a note:
//
//   #link(label("idea:etal"))   a `link` element whose dest is a label
//   @idea:etal                   a `ref` element
//   #window("etal")               the `rookery-window` marker `#window` emits
//   #hyperlink("etal")[...]       the `rookery-link` marker `#hyperlink` emits
//
// `#hyperlink` needs its own marker, like `#window`, because its `link-to:
// "page"` default resolves to a plain href STRING (not a label) whenever a
// page is minted — invisible to the `f == link and type(el.dest) == label`
// check below. `link-to: "anchor"` would have stayed a label link and been
// caught by that check anyway, but the marker covers both modes uniformly
// rather than depending on which one was passed. `#hyperlink` used AS the
// `show ref:` rule needs no marker of its own: it renders a `ref` element,
// already the second shape above.
//
// A `ref` also renders INTO a link, so it can be seen twice; the result is a
// set per page, so seeing it twice costs nothing.
// WHY A CONTENT WALK AND NOT A DEPTH COUNTER. The sweep this replaces got
// "not inside an idea or window" from the `rookery-edge` open/close markers
// `_bracket` emits, counted in document order. A content walk gets the same
// answer structurally, by simply not descending: an `#idea` IS a
// `figure(kind: IK)` in the body it was written into, and a `#window` announces
// itself with a `rookery-window` marker before its own `figure(kind: WK)` exists
// (that figure is built inside a `context`, so at content-walk time there is
// nothing else of it to find — the same fact `_cite-scan` in `bib.typ` is built
// around, and the reason it scans for the marker too).
//
// A page-level `#window` therefore both COUNTS as a page link and STOPS the walk,
// which is right on both counts: the page links to those notes, and whatever the
// transcluded bodies link to belongs to them, not to this page.

// ---- #ideas-outline — a table of contents for THIS page's own ideas -------
//
// Typst's own `#outline()` can't see ideas: it lists `heading` elements, and
// an idea only ever becomes one on the PAGED target (`heading(depth: level,
// ...)`, inside `#idea`'s `else` branch) — never on html/epub, where the
// title renders as a raw `html.elem("h" + ..., ...)`, a plain HTML tag with
// no Typst-level `heading` behind it at all. `#outline()` would therefore
// see every idea on PDF but NONE on the primary html/epub targets. Built
// instead off the same query-time machinery `_page-links` already uses (the
// `rookery-edge` open/close markers `_bracket` wraps every idea AND window
// in), so it works identically on every target.
//
// Nesting is the idea's LITERAL containment depth in the document (one
// `#idea` written inside another's body) — not the author-set `level:`
// (a heading-level knob authors are free to leave untouched regardless of
// nesting, and usually do; concepts.typ's own nested ideas never set it).
// Depth from real nesting means the outline is correct with zero ceremony,
// matching `#idea`'s own "hatch without ceremony" design.
//
// MEASURED, the reason this tracks TWO separate depths (`idea-depth`,
// `window-depth`) instead of one: a `show figure.where(kind: ...): ...`
// rule (which is all `_flatten`'s IK rule is) does NOT remove the original
// figure from `query()` — exactly like `show ref: hyperlink` leaves a `ref`
// still queryable as one (see `_page-links`'s own comment, "a ref also
// renders into a link, so it can be seen twice"). So a note windowed
// (possibly transitively, A-windows-B-windows-C) onto THIS page re-exposes
// every `figure(kind: IK)` its stored body ever contained, each a REAL
// match here, indistinguishable by `kind` alone from one actually hatched
// on this page. Confirmed by a two-page reproduction with mutual
// transclusion (rookery.ohrg.org's index.typ <-> concepts.typ, via
// `#window((<rookery>, <idea>), ...)`): without this check, ideas authored
// elsewhere surfaced nested under the WRONG local idea, several levels deep
// and wrongly attributed. A note is only ever counted at `window-depth ==
// 0`, i.e. not currently inside ANY `#window`'s content, cascaded through
// any number of levels — `idea-depth` (recorded before ITS OWN bracket
// opens) is then a clean count of real enclosing `#idea`s alone.
//
// Scoped to the CURRENT page (`origin`, in `_page-links` terms) unless
// `rookery-wide`: `query()` sees the whole spine (it compiles as one Typst
// document), so the `state("rheo-handle").at(...)` check below is the only
// thing that makes this a page's table of contents rather than the rookery's.
//
// ROOKERY-WIDE drops that check and keeps everything else — one tree of every
// idea in the spine, in spine order, nested by real containment exactly as
// the per-page form is. It substitutes a WEAKER check rather than none at
// all: only vertebrae count. `.marrow.typ` mints one page per note, each
// re-rendering that note's stored body, and a stored body's nested
// `figure(kind: IK)`s stay queryable through the show rule that rebuilds
// them (the same fact the `window-depth` check above turns on). The per-page
// form never had to care — a minted page's handle is `ideas:<slug>`, which
// simply is not `here` — so this hazard arrives with `rookery-wide`, and
// `handle not in spine` is the answer (the same predicate `_is-vertebra`
// applies for `_page-links`, spelled against the handle list this function
// already builds for ordering, so it costs one pass instead of one walk of
// `spine-flat` per entry). MEASURED on a three-vertebra spine: without it,
// `ideas:b-one` and `ideas:i-one` each re-exposed the nested idea in their
// own stored body, listing it a second time.
//
// That guard is gated on `multi-page` and must be: MEASURED on the combined
// PDF, where `.marrow.typ` is skipped outright, every vertebra's
// `state("rheo-handle")` is the empty string — a str, and not in the spine,
// so an ungated check swallowed the entire outline. Applying the guard only
// where the hazard exists is also why no exemption for `""` is needed.
//
// WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE PAGE, the two forms agree and list the whole spine
// — which is the right answer, not a degradation: "this page's ideas" and
// "the rookery's ideas" are the same set when the output is one document.
// Both single-page targets reach it without a special case:
//
//   - the combined PDF, because every vertebra's handle is `""` and so is
//     equal to `here`;
//   - plain `typst compile` with no rheo, because nothing publishes
//     `state("rheo-handle")` at all, so `here` and every handle are `none`.
//
// The second used to be an early `return ()` on a non-str `here`, which made
// a standalone `#ideas-outline()` render its title over an empty list. Not
// worth keeping: the comparison below already gives the correct answer, and
// the two one-page targets now behave identically instead of one listing
// everything and the other nothing.
//
// Neither reorders (see `multi-page` below): a one-page target has one page
// order, its own, and the two forms would otherwise disagree about it on the
// very target where they list the same set.
//
// Untitled ideas (the bare `#idea[body]` form, auto-numbered) are omitted —
// nothing to label them with, and an outline entry is a heading text, not
// an id. Each entry links to `el.location()` directly, no href/label
// reconstruction: VERIFIED to resolve cross-page too under rheo's bundle
// export (`../<page>.html#loc-N`, the same shape `#link(label(id))` gets),

// `depth` (`none` or a positive integer) caps how many nesting LEVELS show,
// counting the same way Typst's own heading `level` does: top-level ideas

  // an unclassed `<h2>`, which took the host site's heading scale and made
  // "Contents" as loud as a section title — for a label on a list of links.
  // The class is what lets it be sized down, and there is nothing else on the
  // element to target.
  //
  // `idea-tab` ALONGSIDE IT, so this title is A HAT — the same object a note's
  // id sits on, a stub of rule out of the corner with the label on its end. The
  // tab treatment goes on the `<h4>` ITSELF rather than wrapping it, because
  // `.idea-tab` is emitted elsewhere as a `<span>` (`_permalink-tab`) and a
  // `<span>` may not contain an `<h4>`; the tab is only `display: flex` plus a
  // `::before`, so an element can wear it directly. It stays an `<h4>` — see
  // above for why the element matters and the stylesheet for how it is kept from
  // reading like one.
  //
  // `_themed`, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. The theme travels as inline custom
  // properties, which inherit DOWN the DOM, and this title is a SIBLING of the
  // `<ul>` rather than a descendant — the same reason `_nest-outline` themes the
  // outermost `<ul>` itself. MEASURED without it, on a project setting
  // `border-color: #ff0000, rule-width: 3px, label-font: Berkeley Mono`: the
  // list drew a 3px red rule while the hat above it drew a 2px last-resort
  // purple stub in the reader's plain monospace — a corner in two colours and
  // two widths. With it, both read `--idea-rule-width`/`--idea-border-color` and
  // the title reads `--idea-label-font`.
