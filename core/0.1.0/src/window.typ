// ---- #window — transclusion, array form, working limit --------------------
//
// `#window("etal")` transcludes the target note: its title, its permalink, and
// its stored (flattened) body, as one foldable block. `names` accepts a
// string, a label, or an array of either — bare (`"etal"`, `<etal>`) or full
// id (`"idea:etal"`, `<idea:etal>` — the same id `@idea:etal` resolves), see
// `_norm`. Reads the registry via `.final()`, not `.get()` — that is what
// lets a note defined in ANOTHER vertebra resolve, since the whole spine
// compiles as one Typst document.
//
// `tags:` selects notes instead of naming them, and COMBINES with the names
// rather than replacing them: the window shows the union of what was named and
// what carries the tags, with a note that is both appearing once, where it was
// named. `match:` is "any" (the default) or "all". Selection is always
// rookery-wide — the registry is the whole bundle's, so where the window sits
// makes no difference to what a tag pulls in. Either half may be omitted, but
// not both.
//
// `sort:` is `auto`, "date" or "lexicographic". `auto` keeps named ids in
// call-site order and appends the tag matches by id, so a window that names
// its notes and asks for no sort behaves exactly as it always has; naming a
// sort orders the whole selection instead. See `_sort-ids`.
//
// A `#window` is pure presentation: it never registers, never advances the
// counter, and never re-registers a nested `#idea`. That guarantee is
// delivered by `_flatten` (defined above, next to `IK`/`WK`), not by any
// suppression logic here.
//
// `depth:` is the transclusion budget (see `_window-depth` for the whole
// scale): `0` transcludes nothing and renders this window as a LINK to the
// note's page, `1` renders the note and collapses a `#window` written inside it
// to its bare permalink, `n` unfurls n-1 levels of those as real windows.
// `auto`, the default, takes the document-wide setting from
// `#show: rookery.with(window-depth: n)` — which itself defaults to 1, the
// one-level rendering every document already has. Per call site, because
// "unfurl the whole tree here", "show it" and "just point at it" are all
// reasonable on the same page: an index that shows one note in full wants
// depth, a backlinks list of forty does not, and a dense index may want no
// transclusion at all.
//
// Nesting counts WINDOWS only. A `#idea` written inside a transcluded note is
// always rebuilt in full whatever the budget (that is `_flatten`'s IK rule,
// and it cannot cycle — an idea's body is finite and literally contains its
// nested ones), so `depth` measures exactly the thing that can cycle.
//
// Rendering — `folded`, `show-date`, `limit:`, click budget: `_window-content`.

  // where everything below is still an unevaluated `context` block with
  // nothing inspectable in it — so the names are announced up front, in an
  // invisible `metadata` element, where the walk can see them without
  // rendering anything.
  //
  // Bare names, not full ids: this runs outside `context`, so `_pfx()` is not
  // available here. `_outbound` re-adds the prefix, which it can.
  //
  // Only the NAMED ids can be announced. A tag selection is not known until
  // the registry is readable, which needs `context`, and by then this walk has
  // already happened — so tag-matched notes get no backlink from this window.
  // That asymmetry is documented in the readme; do not "fix" it by announcing
  // the tags instead, which would have `_outbound` read the registry while it
  // is still being built.
  // LABELLED, so `query()` can find it as well as the content walk.
  //
  // `_page-outbound` walks a vertebra's content at `#show: rookery` time to
  // build its backlink beacon, and that walk CANNOT ENTER A CONTEXT BLOCK — the
  // body does not exist until layout. So a `#window` emitted from inside one
  // announced itself to nobody, and every note it transcluded lost its backlink
  // from the page transcluding it. Not a corner case: any package that computes
  // which notes to window must do so inside a context, since reading the
  // registry needs one. MEASURED with `@rookery/todos`'s
  // `#todos-ready(windows: true)`, which produced no backlinks at all while a
  // hand-written window on the same page produced them.
  //
  // The label costs nothing here and lets `_page-links` pick these up by query
  // instead. THE MARKER STAYS OUTSIDE THE CONTEXT BLOCK BELOW, which is the
  // whole point: `_page-links` resolves which page it sits on with
  // `state("rheo-handle").at(el.location())`, the positional read
  // `_ideas-outline-data` already uses. Reading `.get()` from inside the
  // context instead was tried and REVERTED — it made a document with minted
  // pages fail to converge in five attempts, because the value observed
  // depended on where the surrounding layout had got to.

// The note's body as the REAL Typst-rendered thing — links, styling,
// footnotes, citations — not the plain string `#ideas()`'s `body` field
// gives out. For a consumer that wants to show the actual note rather than
// tell about it, the way `@rookery/search`'s preview pane does: a
// `body` string can be matched and excerpted, and that is exactly what it is
// for, but a code block inside it reads as bare, unstyled source text with
// no separation from the prose around it — MEASURED as "Typst markup peeking
// through" the moment a note quotes any code at all. Rendering the real
// content fixes that at the root: the browser gets an actual `<pre><code>`,
// not a paragraph that happens to contain one.
//
// NOT `#window`, despite doing almost the same rendering underneath. Two
// differences, both load-bearing:
//
//   1. `#window` ANNOUNCES the note it shows, up front, via the same
//      `metadata((rookery-window: ids))` marker `_outbound` reads at
//      REGISTRATION time to build the backlinks graph — a note shown in a
//      `#window` counts as a link TO it from wherever the window sits. That
//      is correct for a window written into a note's own prose, and
//      catastrophic for a call site meant to run once per note on EVERY
//      page, as a search preview does: every page on the site would end up
//      "linking" to every note in the whole rookery. `idea-body` skips the
//      announcement entirely — it renders, and nothing more.
//   2. `#window` draws chrome: a summary line (title, permalink, date) and a
//      `<details>` disclosure. `idea-body` is body only, always fully shown
//      — a caller wanting a title has it already, from whatever listed the
//      note in the first place (`#ideas()`'s `text` field, here).
//
// STILL `_bracket`ed, the same edges `#window` draws, for the same reason
// `#window` needs them: `_page-links` walks a page's own outbound links by
// COUNTING BRACKET DEPTH (see `_edge`), and unbracketed content here would
// make every link inside every previewed note look like a link the page
// itself wrote — corrupting the page-backlinks half of `.marrow.typ`'s
// Backlinks section for every page that calls this.
//
// Wrapped in `.idea-window`/`.idea-window-body` — the same classes
// `#window` wraps its own body in — so it inherits every rule core.css
// already writes for prose inside a window: link colours, raw/code styling,
// list and footnote layout. A consumer never has to restyle any of that
// itself. `_themed` carries the document's theme along as an inline style,
// the same way every other container this package emits does, since a
// caller's own container (rookery-search's hidden preview templates, say)
// has no `.idea-*` ancestor to inherit the custom properties from.
//
// `limit:` truncates by BLOCK — a paragraph, a list — the same unit
// `#window`'s own `limit:` uses, because that is the unit that can be cut
// without leaving half a sentence. `none` (the default) shows the whole
// body.
//
// `depth` is the same transclusion budget `#window` takes (see
// `_window-depth`); `1` (the default) renders the body with any nested
// `#window` collapsed to its permalink rather than unfurled, which keeps a
// preview's own size bounded regardless of how deep the note it is showing
// nests. PINNED rather than `auto` for that reason, and `1` rather than `0`
// because this function's job is to render a body: `@rookery/search`'s
// preview pane calls it without passing `depth` at all, and a default of 0
// would turn every search preview into a link. (`depth: 0` here renders the
// body all the same — there is no chrome and no link shape to fall back to,
// which is `#window`'s job; it simply asks for no unfurling, as `1` does.)
//
// HTML/EPUB only, like `#window`'s own chrome — its only realistic consumer
// is a web preview, and `html.elem` is what builds the `.idea-window`
// wrapping. On a paged target the body still renders, just without that
// wrapping, so a stray direct call does not hard-error.
