// `#idea-row` — ONE ROW SHAPE for every list of notes.
//
// `when | title | badges` had been written five times across this repo and its first
// consumer, and the badge chip was specified in three stylesheets: this package's hat
// pill, `@rookery/search`'s own chips, and `@rookery/timeline`'s
// `.upcoming-stage` — whose comment says outright that it "copies the SHAPE instead,
// the same way @rookery/search's own chips do". One object, three hand copies.
// This is the object.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN CORE. rookery-search and rookery-timeline both already import this
// package, so the row costs no new package edge; search could not host it, because
// rheo scans only a PROJECT's own imports and never a package's — a project reaching
// search's row THROUGH rookery-timeline would get the markup with neither that
// package's CSS nor its JS, which is a silent failure its own readme documents. Core
// also already owns everything the five copies reach for: `.idea-tag`, and the
// generated `@layer rookery-tags` rules that publish `--idea-tag-bg` /
// `--idea-tag-color` / `--idea-tag-line` per themed tag.
//
// NO JAVASCRIPT, and no breach of core's no-JS rule: a row is markup plus a class
// contract. Interaction stays in rookery-search.
//
// CELLS ARRIVE FORMATTED, which is the whole of the design. The row asks no questions
// about dates, stages or tags — a caller knows its own data model and fills the cells.
// That is what lets one row serve a log-derived queue (`#upcoming`), a
// `created`-ordered filter panel, and a hand-built table of submissions, none of which
// agree about what a date means.

#import "state.typ": _c

// A row is HTML-ONLY, deliberately. A paged target has no grid to align and no anchor
// to click, and every view in this family already keeps a `target() != "html"` branch
// that builds its own `list(..)`. Reaching this function from one is a bug in the
// caller, so it says so rather than emitting `html.elem` into a PDF — where it would
// fail with a message about the element, not about the mistake.
#let _paged-panic = (
  "@rookery/core: #idea-row is HTML-only and was called on a paged target. "
    + "A view keeps its own `if target() != \"html\"` branch and renders `list(..)` "
    + "there; this row draws the grid the HTML branch needs."
)

// THE ROW'S CHILDREN, WITHOUT THE `<li>` AROUND THEM, and the split is forced by a
// caller rather than chosen for tidiness. @rookery/search ships TWO widgets that
// want this shape and disagree about who owns the list item: `#filter-panel` builds
// its own `<ul>` and uses `#idea-row` AS the `<li>`, while `#panel` wraps whatever its
// `render:` returns in an `<li class="panel-row" data-<field>=..>` of its own — so a
// `#panel` row rendered with `#idea-row` nests one `<li>` inside another.
//
// The alternative was a consumer re-emitting these four spans to drop the wrapper,
// which is the fifth hand copy this file's header exists to prevent. So: the shape
// lives here once, and the wrapper is the part a caller can decline.
//
// NO `tags`, `extra` OR `attrs` — those all describe the `<li>`, and a caller reaching
// for this function has its own.
//
// `when-class:` AND `when-attrs:` ARE THE SAME HOLE AS `attrs:` (below), ONE LEVEL IN.
// A consumer that wants to say something about the DATE — @rookery/todos bands the
// cell by how close a deadline is, and hangs the phrase off it as a tooltip — could
// otherwise only reach that span by re-emitting all four of them, which is the fifth
// hand copy this file's header exists to prevent. It is not a breach of "the row asks
// no questions": the CALLER computes the band and the label; the row still asks nothing
// about what a date means, it only carries what it was handed. Core defines no
// `.idea-row-when-*` classes of its own and styles none of them — those names belong to
// the consumer, exactly as `data-panel-*` on the `<li>` does.
//
// ADDITIVE: with neither passed, the emitted markup is byte-identical to what it was
// before they existed. `when-attrs` merges UNDER the computed `class`, for the same
// reason `attrs:` does — a caller cannot accidentally drop the cell's own classes.

  // themed tag's colours on — so a badge colours itself with no code here.
  //
  // NOT WRAPPED IN `.idea-tab`, which carries the hat's own pill rule: that
  // element draws a stub of rule through its `::before`, which inside a row reads
  // as a stray dash. The stylesheet shares the SHAPE between the two selectors
  // instead.
