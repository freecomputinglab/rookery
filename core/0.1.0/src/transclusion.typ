// ---- Transclusion: edge markers, window content, _flatten, _body-at ------
//
// A link that sits DIRECTLY in a page — in its prose, or a page-level `#window`
// — is a backlink from that page. A link inside a note is a backlink from the
// note, and must not also be counted for the page or for any note enclosing
// it. So the question is only ever "how deep am I", and these two invisible
// markers answer it: `#idea` brackets its rendered body with them, `#window`
// brackets each note it transcludes, and `_page-links` walks the document in
// order keeping a depth count. Depth 0 is the page itself.
//
// Bracketing `#window` is what makes a TRANSCLUDED body behave: a note shown on
// five pages renders its links on all five, and without the brackets each of
// those pages would look like it linked directly to whatever the note links
// to. Inside the brackets they are at depth 1 and belong to the note.
//
// REFUTED ALTERNATIVE, do not retry: `show metadata: none` inside `_flatten`,
// to strip a stored body's markers instead of nesting them. MEASURED — a
// metadata element hidden by a show rule is STILL returned by `query`, so it
// strips nothing that matters and the duplicates survive.
//
// Defined BEFORE `_flatten`: its IK rule brackets a reconstructed nested
// header+box itself now, so it needs `_bracket` in scope at definition time.
//
// `container` (IK or WK) rides along on top of `edge` ("open"/"close") so a
// reader of the marker (currently just `#ideas-outline`) can tell an IDEA's
// own bracket apart from a WINDOW's — `_page-links`/`_outbound` don't care
// which, only "how deep", so this is purely additive: an extra key on the
// same dict, ignored by every existing reader.
#let _edge(edge, container) = metadata((rookery-edge: edge, rookery-container: container))
#let _bracket(body, container) = _edge("open", container) + body + _edge("close", container)

// ONE rendering of ONE window — summary row, disclosure, body — shared by
// `#window` itself and by `_flatten`'s WK rule when `depth` lets it expand a
// nested window instead of collapsing it. Shared so the two cannot drift: an
// expanded nested window must be indistinguishable from the same `#window`
// written at the top level, or `depth:` would introduce a second, lesser
// rendering of the same thing.
//
// Takes `shown` already truncated (the caller owns `limit:`) and emits NO
// `figure`/`_bracket` wrapper — the two callers wrap differently. `#window`
// needs the `figure(kind: WK)` so an enclosing `_flatten` can find and
// collapse it; the expansion deliberately emits no such figure, since it has
// already been claimed.
//
// `folded` sets only the INITIAL disclosure state — `false` (the default)
// renders `<details open>`, `true` renders it closed. It is not a second
// layout: a folded window and an unfolded one are the same block, so a reader
// who opens one sees exactly what a `#window` beside it already shows.
// `limit:` is therefore meaningful in both (it truncates the body that folding
// hides) and the two are orthogonal.
//
// CLICK BUDGET (HTML/EPUB) — the whole point of this shape, modelled on
// Forester (www.forester-notes.org, whose `tree.xsl` renders every transcluded
// tree as a `<details>` whose `<summary>` holds the title and an
// `<a class="slug">[tfmt-0006]</a>`):
//
//   - clicking ANYWHERE in the summary — title, date, the whitespace between
//     them — folds or unfolds, and does nothing else;
//   - clicking the `[idea:etal]` permalink, and only that, opens the note's
//     own page.
//
// So the transcluded body is NOT a link and there is no trailing arrow. Both
// were tried and removed. An outer <a> around the body is invalid the moment
// that body contains its own link (MEASURED: browsers and typst's HTML export
// both truncate the outer anchor where the inner one starts and never resume
// it, so only "the first bit" stays clickable), and the arrow was a second
// navigational affordance competing with the permalink for the same click.
//
// The disclosure is native `<details>`/`<summary>`: this package ships no JS,
// and a `:target`/checkbox CSS hack would need a unique control id per window.
// An `<a>` INSIDE `<summary>` does not break the toggle — only an `<a>` around
// the whole summary does, which is what the earlier folded-row design got
// wrong. The permalink navigates on its own click; the summary keeps the rest.
//
// `show-date` is OFF by default, same as `#idea`'s own — a date is always
// RESOLVED and stored on the note's registry record regardless, so passing
// `show-date: true` here can surface it even for a note whose own `#idea`
// call left it hidden; the two are independent per call site, not one shared
// setting.
//
// Must be called from inside a `context` block: `_permalink` reads the page
// handle and the prefix state. Both callers already are.

  // until 0.6.0 and this hat showed it, on the argument that a reader wants to
  // know when a note was last touched. Core no longer answers that: a
  // hand-maintained `updated:` is a second date that can contradict the note's
  // actual history, and @rookery/timeline now stores a dated log and derives
  // last-touched from it. A project wanting that in a window hat passes it, or
