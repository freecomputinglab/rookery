// Mints one output page per registered note, at ideas/<id>.html, so a note
// gets a real URL instead of only an in-page fragment anchor on whatever page
// it happens to be written in. Reachable purely by importing this package —
// no rheo.toml entry, no project file needed — because rheo inlines a
// package's `.marrow.typ` verbatim at the bundle root (see typst_manifest.rs
// in rheo core). Skipped automatically for the combined PDF target, which
// rejects `document()`/`asset()` outright.
//
// Reach the package's own code by package spec, never a relative import: this
// text is spliced into rheo's synthesized bundle root, so a relative path
// would resolve against the PROJECT root, not this file's own directory.
//
// The `<prefix>:` stripped off each id to get a slug comes from `_pfx` (the
// document-wide prefix state), never a literal — a project running
// `#show: rookery.with(prefix: "note")` must mint at the same paths lib.typ
// links to. This file no longer strips it itself for the minting path:
// `_note-page` returns the slug, the file and the handle together, and reads
// that one state on this file's behalf.
//
// Deliberately does NOT re-declare the note's `<prefix>:<id>` Typst label on the
// minted page. Two elements sharing one label break every #link/#window/
// #hyperlink resolution to it as soon as either is referenced (labels only
// error on ambiguous lookup, not on declaration — see the epic's "Verified
// facts"). The label stays owned by the anchor #idea creates at the note's
// original call site; #link/#window/#hyperlink keep resolving there. The
// permalink on the minted page is a plain same-page HTML fragment
// (`href="#" + id` against this page's own heading `id` attribute), not a
// second declaration of the Typst label.
//
// Minted with `rheo-document`, not a bare `document()`, per rheo core's own
// guidance (crates/core/src/typ/rheo.typ): a bare `document()` skips
// `rheo-page-init`, so the page never publishes a handle of its own and
// inherits whatever `state("rheo-handle")` the spine left behind. Every
// depth-relative href computed ON this page then rides on that inherited
// value — rheo's cross-vertebra link rule, and lib.typ's `_note-href`.
// MEASURED on this package's own demo: the bare form happens to emit the same
// `../` prefix, because the inherited handle is one level deep just as
// `ideas/<slug>` is. That is a coincidence of this spine's shape, not a
// guarantee. Passing the handle makes the depth this page's own property. It
// mirrors the path — `ideas/<slug>.html` <-> `ideas:<slug>` — with both halves
// coming from lib.typ's `_note-page`, so minting and linking cannot drift.
// The permalink comes from lib.typ's `_permalink-tab` — the same top rule a
// note wears inside a card — with the href forced to this page's own fragment,
// because a minted page must not link to itself. Building the <a> by hand here
// instead is how it came to miss the configurable hover property that every
// other permalink carries.
// CONTEXT FOOTER. A minted page shows the note stripped of everything around
// it, which is the point — but a reader who lands on one has no way back to
// the argument it was written inside. The footer names that page and links to
// the note's own anchor within it, not merely to the top of it.
//
// The link is `#link(label(id))`, i.e. Typst's own cross-document label
// resolution, which exports as `<origin>.html#loc-N` — the anchor `#idea`
// declared at the call site. Two rules could have intercepted it and neither
// does: rheo's `show link:` rewrite only touches links whose target is a
// `rheo-handle` figure (this one is a `rheo-idea-anchor`), and it is exactly
// that rewrite which DROPS the fragment and lands on the top of a page. So
// `#link(<index>)` would have been the wrong tool here despite being the
// obvious one — it goes to the page, not to the note in it.
// BACKLINKS. The inverse of every note's recorded outbound links (see
// `_outbound` in lib.typ): the notes that point AT this one, in registry order.
// Built once for the whole run rather than per page — inverting the map costs
// one pass over the registry, doing it inside the loop would cost one per note.
//
// Only notes appear here. A link written in a page's ordinary prose, outside
// any `#idea`, cannot: nothing records it, because the registry is the only
// thing this package can see and it holds notes, not pages. That is also why
// the list can be rendered as `#window`s at all — every entry is by construction
// a thing there is a note to show.
// PAGE TEMPLATE. A minted page is a `#document` spliced in HERE, at the bundle
// root, so it is outside every vertebra and inherits none of the project's own
// `#show:` chrome — no site header, no nav. `#show: rookery.with(
// idea-page-template: ...)` is how a project hands one over; this file applies
// applied. `none` (the default) mints the bare page this always produced.
// Every name here is INTERNAL to `@rookery/core` and load-bearing for this
// file. lib.typ carries the matching "CONSUMED BY .marrow.typ" banner; renaming
// or re-signing any of them means changing both files in the same commit.
// SYNDICATION BEACON. Opt-in via `#show: rookery.with(syndicate: true)`
// (default off — a package must not emit into another package's label
// namespace unasked). When on, each minted note page also carries a
// `#metadata((..)) <feeds:item>` beacon shaped to the contract
// `@rheo/feeds`'s `items()` reads (see that package's readme and the
// `<feeds:item>` label — `feeds:item` is `items()`'s own default
// `label-name`). Emitted whether or not `@rheo/feeds` is installed at
// all: this file never imports it, and an unread `#metadata` beacon is
// inert — `#metadata` renders nothing on any target, so a project with no
// feeds in its dependency tree pays nothing for a beacon nobody queries.
// This is the SECONDARY syndication path — a project's own `.marrow.typ` (or
// any package) sourcing `ideas(tags:, match:)` straight into feeds's
// `items()` is the primary one; this exists for what that route cannot
// reach, e.g. a hand-authored page syndicating itself.

  // THE DEPTH A MINTED PAGE RENDERS ITS NOTE AT, and it is `window-depth` PLUS

  // A minted page shows the note as the page's own top level — it is not a
  // transclusion of it. So a `#window` written directly in the note's body is
  // a TOP-LEVEL window there, exactly as it is on the page the note was
  // hatched in, and it gets a top-level window's own budget. What
  // `window-depth` governs is windows nested inside a transcluded body, and on
  // a minted page the first body that is genuinely transcluded is the one
  // inside that top-level window — one level in, which is why the budget is
  // shifted by one rather than merely floored at 1.
  //
  // Unchanged by the depth-0 rebasing of the scale (see `_window-depth`), and
  // the arithmetic is why: `+ 1` says "windows in this body get the budget a
  // TOP-LEVEL window has", which is `window-depth` itself whatever number that
  // is. At the default of 1 the body is flattened at 2 — its windows render,
  // theirs collapse — exactly as it was flattened at 1 when the default was 0.

  // itself uses at 0.

  // directly under prose reading "Try unfolding these windows below by
  // clicking on their title panel" — there was nothing to unfold. Passing

  // and a hardcoded directory here would put the index somewhere else.
  //
  // ROWS BUILT FROM `ideas()`, not from `#ideas-outline`. The outline links each
  // row to the note's ANCHOR on the vertebra that authored it
  // (`../index.html#loc-1`), which is right for a table of contents sitting on
  // that page and wrong for this one: `ideas/index.html` is the index OF the
  // minted pages, so its rows must point AT them.
  //
  // BUT NOT FROM `ideas()`'s OWN `href`, and this is the trap. `href` is
  // `_note-href`, which measures depth from `state("rheo-handle")` — and `ideas()`
  // is called HERE, at marrow scope, OUTSIDE the `rheo-document` below. The state
  // still holds the last spine vertebra's handle, which is depth 0, so every href
  // came back `ideas/<slug>.html`: right for a page at the site root, and from
  // `ideas/index.html` a resolution to `ideas/ideas/<slug>.html`. MEASURED on a
  // 82-note site: all 82 rows 404. The same hazard, seen from the other side, is
  // the comment above the backlink list further up this file — a nested `context`
  // resolves after `rheo-document` has published this page's own handle, which is
  // why `#window`'s permalinks were always right.
  //
  // The fix is not a nested `context` here, though it would work: this page is the
  // deepest document in the bundle, and a site whose introspection chain is
  // already near Typst's five-iteration cap cannot spare the round. It does not
  // need one. Every minted note page is a SIBLING of this one — both live under
  // `_dir()` — so the correct href is the note's bare file basename, with no
  // depth arithmetic and no state to read at all. `_note-page` is the same helper
  // the mint loop above takes its paths from, so the rows still cannot drift from
  // what was minted.
  //
  // It wears `#ideas-outline`'s classes — `.idea-outline`, `.idea-outline-row`,
  // `.idea-tag-<tag>` — so the stylesheet already knows this page and it needs
  // no CSS of its own. Not a folded `#window` per note: a folded window over
  // EVERY note on one page is the shape that made a real site's homepage 5.1 MB.
  //
  // ID ORDER, which is what `ideas()` returns. The outline's spine order reads
  // better and is not reachable here without the anchors that come with it.
  //
  // `note: (:)` for the template, and `id: none`: this page is the rookery, not
